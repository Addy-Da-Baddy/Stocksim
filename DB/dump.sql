The core assumption is that all publicly known fundamentals have factored into price; thus, there is no need to pay close attention to them. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a security\'s intrinsic value, but instead, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/09/mcginley-dynamic-indicator.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">use stock charts to identify patterns</a> and trends that&nbsp;suggest how a stock\'s price will move in the future.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_55-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<span class=\"heading-toc\" id=\"toc-limitations-of-technical-analysis\"></span><h2 id=\"mntl-sc-block_56-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading\"> <span class=\"mntl-sc-block-heading__text\"> Limitations of Technical Analysis </span> </h2>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_57-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> <strong>1.</strong> For some analysts and academic researchers, the EMH demonstrates why no actionable information is contained in <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/historic-pricing.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">historical price</a> and volume data. However, by the same reasoning, nor should business fundamentals provide actionable information. These points of view are known as the weak form and semi-strong form of the EMH.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_58-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_59-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> <strong>2.</strong> Another criticism of technical analysis is that history does not repeat itself exactly, so price pattern study is of dubious importance and can be ignored. Prices seem to be better modeled as a random walk.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_60-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_61-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> <strong>3.</strong> A third criticism of technical analysis is that it works in some cases but only because it constitutes a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, many technical traders will place a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">stop-loss order</a>&nbsp;below the 200-day moving average of a certain company.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_62-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_63-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> If a large number of traders have done so and the stock reaches this price, there will be a large number of sell orders, which will push the stock price down, confirming the movement traders anticipated.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_64-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_65-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> Then, other traders will see the price decrease and sell their positions, reinforcing the strength of the trend. This short-term selling pressure can be considered self-fulfilling, but it will have little bearing on where the asset\'s price will be weeks or months from now.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_66-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_67-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> In sum, if enough people use the same signals, they could cause the movement foretold by the signal.

Consider Real Estate </span> </h2>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_28-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> There are many advantages to investing in real estate. This asset class has intrinsic value and provides consistent income through dividends. It often acts as a good inflation hedge since there will always be a demand for homes, regardless of the economic climate, and because as inflation rises, so do property values, and therefore the amount a landlord can charge for rent.<br>\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_29-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_30-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> Because real estate is a tangible asset, however, it\'s illiquid. An alternative to consider is <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">real estate investment trusts (REITs)</a>, which are more liquid investments and can be bought and sold easily in the markets.

Another key advantage is that their prices probably won’t be as affected when rates start to rise, because their operating costs are going to remain largely unchanged. An example of a REIT with broad exposure to real estate and a low expense ratio is the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=vnq\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">VNQ</a>).<br>\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_33-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_34-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-callout--note finance-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-note finance-sc-block-callout--generic\" data-tracking-id=\"mntl-sc-block-callout\" data-tracking-container=\"true\"> <h3 class=\"mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading\">Fast Fact</h3>\n<div class=\"mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body\"><p>Many of these investments are complex instruments, and novice investors may be wise to buy them through a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF).

During a bear market, prices tend to drop 20% or more. In most cases, bear markets involve whole indexes.

These <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rally.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">rallies</a>, which can be a result of speculation and hype, don\'t last very long.

When everyone who wants to buy has bought, there are no more buyers. At this point, the market must turn lower. Similarly, when everyone who wants to sell has sold, no more sellers remain. So when market experts and the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forecasting.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">forecasts</a> are telling you to sell, sell, sell—or buy, buy, buy—be sure to know that everyone is jumping on that bandwagon, so much so that there\'s nothing left to sell or buy.

Well, unless you\'re a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">short seller</a>.

It is typically measured by the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">standard deviation</a> of the return of an investment over a certain period.

One explanation is that investor reactions are caused by psychological forces.

This means <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/09/long-term-stock-pick.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">staying invested</a> and not paying attention to short-term fluctuations.

For example, in the past, some <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"2\">market-maker</a> firms have temporarily discontinued normal automatic order executions and handled orders manually.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_37-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_38-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> How securities are executed during times of volatile prices and high volume is also different in other ways.

These high volumes may also cause executions to occur at prices that are very different from the market price quoted at the time the order was entered. Investors should ask firms to explain how market makers handle order executions when the market is volatile. With the proliferation of online&nbsp;trading, we have come to expect quick executions at prices at or near the quotes displayed on our internet-enabled devices. Take into account that this isn\'t always the case.</li>\n<li><strong>Digital mayhem:</strong>&nbsp;You may have difficulty executing your trades because of the limitations of a system\'s capacity. In addition, if you are trading online, you may have trouble accessing your account due to high levels of internet traffic. For these reasons, most online trading firms offer alternatives like phone trades or talking to a broker over the phone to initiate an order.</li>\n<li><strong>Incorrect quotes:</strong>&nbsp;There can be major price discrepancies between the quote you receive and the price at which your trade is executed. Remember, in a volatile market environment, even <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/real-time-quote.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">real-time quotes (RTQs)</a> may be far behind what is currently happening in the market.

Limit orders may cost slightly more than market orders but are always a good idea to use because the price at which you will purchase or sell securities is set. On the flip side, a limit order does not guarantee you an execution if the limit price is never triggered.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_47-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_48-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> Investors need to be aware of the potential risks during times of volatility.

If a margin account\'s value <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwater.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">drops below the required level</a>, the broker will require the account holder to add money to their account.

This typically must happen within 2-5 business days (sometimes fewer in volatile markets).</li>\n<li><strong>Forced Liquidation</strong>: If investors cannot or do not respond to a margin call within the required time frame, brokers have the contractual right to sell securities in the account without prior consultation or additional notice.

Longer time horizons often allow for more aggressive investment strategies, while shorter ones may require more conservative approaches. The longer you give yourself, the less conservative you\'ll need to be early on.</li><li><strong>Evaluate your finances</strong>: Be realistic about how much you can put toward your investment goals, considering your savings, regular income, and any other financial resources.</li><li><strong>Rank your goals</strong>: Most of us balance several goals at once, and we have to prioritize saving for a home down payment, paying for a wedding next year, or preparing for retirement based on urgency and importance. For example, saving for a down payment on a house might take precedence over planning a vacation.</li><li><strong>Adapt as life changes</strong>: The phrase financial planning is best taken as a verb, not a noun. It\'s an ongoing process that should evolve with your needs and aspirations. You might fall in love or out of it, have many children or none of them, or realize your life’s work means moving cross country.

Solid does not mean perfect. This fund should cover a few months\' worth of major expenses, such as mortgage or rent payments and other essential bills.</li>\n<li><strong>Pay off high-interest debts</strong>: Financial planners typically recommend paying down high-interest debts, such as credit card balances. The returns from investing in stocks are unlikely to outweigh the costs of high interest accumulating on these debts. Thus, scrutinize each of your debts similarly, weighing the interest payments against potential investment returns. Likely, your debts will have to come first.</li>\n<li><strong>Create a budget</strong>: Based on your financial assessment, decide how much money you can comfortably invest in stocks. You also want to know if you\'re starting with a lump sum or smaller amounts put in over time. Your budget should ensure that you are not dipping into funds you need for expenses.</li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_28-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_29-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> Don\'t worry if your funds are less than you would wish.

At certain points in our lives, our risk tolerance may change.

EMH states that everything known about an investment product is immediately factored into the price.

They look at a variety of factors that they believe influence a stock\'s performance. These include the industry as a whole, the competition, a company\'s management structure, its income and <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">revenue</a>, as well as its growth potential.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_13-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<span class=\"heading-toc\" id=\"toc-example-of-stock-fundamentals\"></span><h2 id=\"mntl-sc-block_14-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading\"> <span class=\"mntl-sc-block-heading__text\"> Example of Stock Fundamentals </span> </h2>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_15-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> All of the data is public and readily available, generally through a company\'s <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">financial statements</a>.

Think of the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">stock market</a> as a shopping mall, where stocks are the items for sale in the retail outlets.

Once the crowd moves on from, say, the personal computers (PCs), they will take a closer look at the ones that were passed over.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_20-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_21-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> Fundamental analysts may take a stab at determining the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scrap-value.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">scrap value</a> of the PC stripped down to its hard disk, memory cards, monitor, and keyboard. In the stock market, this is akin to calculating the book value, or <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"2\">liquidation</a> price, of a company.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_22-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_23-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> These analysts also take a very close look at the quality of the PC. Is it going to last or will it break down within a year? The fundamental analysts will pore over the specifications, scrutinize the manufacturer\'s <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warranty.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">warranty</a>, and consult <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-reports.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"2\">consumer reports</a>.

These are like the forecast <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">earnings</a> and dividends identified from a company\'s income statement.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_26-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_27-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> Finally, the fundamental analysts will put together all the data and come up with the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">intrinsic value</a>, or value independent of the current sale price.

By taking the trouble to dig into a company\'s financial statements and assessing its future prospects, investors can learn enough to know when the stock price is wrong.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_31-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_32-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> These conscientious investors are able to spot the market\'s mistakes and make themselves money. At the same time, buying companies based on intrinsic, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longterm.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">long-term</a> value protects investors from the dangers of day-to-day market fluctuations.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_33-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_34-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> However, the fact that fundamental analysis shows that a stock is <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">undervalued</a> does not guarantee it will trade at its intrinsic value any time soon. Things are not so simple. In reality, real share price behavior relentlessly calls into question almost every stock holding, and even the most independently-minded investor can start doubting the merits of fundamental analysis. There is no magic formula for figuring out intrinsic value.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_35-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_36-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-important finance-sc-block-callout--generic\" data-tracking-id=\"mntl-sc-block-callout\" data-tracking-container=\"true\"> <h3 class=\"mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading\">Important</h3>\n<div class=\"mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body\"><p>Just because fundamental analysis shows that a stock is undervalued doesn\'t guarantee it will trade at its intrinsic value in the near future.</p></div>\n<div id=\"finance-sc-block-callout__icon-container_1-0\" class=\"comp finance-sc-block-callout__icon-container mntl-block\"><svg class=\"icon finance-sc-block-callout__icon--important \">\n<use xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#finance-sc-block-callout__icon--important\" href=\"#finance-sc-block-callout__icon--important\"></use>\n</svg></div></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_37-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> When the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">stock market</a> is booming, it is easy for investors to fool themselves into thinking they have a knack for picking winners.

In essence, the theory of technical analysis is rooted in the fact that the movement in price is not random. Instead, it believes that patterns and <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trend.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">trends</a> are identifiable and repeat over time.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_43-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_44-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> To demonstrate, let\'s go back to the analogy above.

The wall was taken down in 1699, but the name stuck.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\"></span>\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_35-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_36-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> Given its proximity to New York\'s ports, the Wall Street area became a bustling center of trade in the 1700s. Its origins as a financial center began in&nbsp;1792, when 24 of the most prominent&nbsp;brokers&nbsp;and merchants in the U.S. signed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buttonwoodagreement.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">Buttonwood&nbsp;Agreement</a>.

In effect, it was an effort to establish a members-only stock exchange. Some of the first securities traded were war bonds and&nbsp;the stocks of such institutions as the Bank of New York.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\"></span><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\"></span>\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_39-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_40-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> Out of this acorn of an agreement, the oak that became the NYSE grew. In 1817, the Buttonwood brokers renamed themselves The New York Stock and Exchange Board. The organization rented out spaces for trading in several locations until 1865, when it settled on a location of its own, at the corner of Wall and Broad Streets.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\"></span>\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_41-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_42-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-callout--note finance-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-note \" data-tracking-id=\"mntl-sc-block-callout\" data-tracking-container=\"true\"> <h3 class=\"mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading\">18 Broad Street</h3>\n<div class=\"mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body\"><p>The location of the beating heart of Wall Street, the NYSE, is a 1903 Neo-Classical structure of white marble.

The three men were reporters, but Dow was also a numbers-cruncher who came up with the idea of creating a benchmark list of companies and their stock prices to represent the entire stock market.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_59-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_60-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> Soon, the <em>Journal</em> was publishing the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)</a> index along with hundreds of prices of company stocks, bonds, and futures, and the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wall-street-journal-prime-rate.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"2\">average prime rate </a>for bank loans.

The fact that they chose to name their new publication <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> indicates that Wall Street already was something of an umbrella term for the world of finance and its denizens. Over the years, the paper helped fix this meaning in the public\'s mind.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_65-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"mntl-sc-block_66-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading\"> <span class=\"mntl-sc-block-subheading__text\"> 1920: The Wall Street Bombing </span> </h3>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_67-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> It was around noon on Sept. 16, 1920. A horse-drawn cart pulled up at 23 Wall Street right in front of the headquarters of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. A bustling corner of the neighborhood, it was especially crowded with those headed out for lunch. The cart suddenly exploded. It had been packed with dynamite and filled with sash weights that sailed through the air.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_68-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_69-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> At that time, it was the worst domestic bombing in U.S. history. Ultimately, 40 people were killed or died from their injuries, and another 300 were injured. The J.P. Morgan building\'s interior was gutted.

But because the explosion occurred in front of the Morgan building, known as a symbol of American capitalism, the bombing was ultimately decided to have been an act of terrorism performed by “Reds”—anarchists and communist sympathizers. A stack of anarchist flyers found in a mailbox a block away from Wall Street supported this theory.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span>\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_72-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_73-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> As a result, the authorities arrested hundreds of suspected Reds and deported those of foreign nationality.

During the intervening period, there were marches and speeches, calling for more balanced income distribution, better-paying jobs, bank reform, and less corporate influence in politics.&nbsp;\"We are the 99%,\" was the Occupy protestors\' slogan.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_108-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<span class=\"heading-toc\" id=\"toc-the-regulation-of-wall-street\"></span><h2 id=\"mntl-sc-block_109-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading\"> <span class=\"mntl-sc-block-heading__text\"> The Regulation of Wall Street </span> </h2>\n<h3 id=\"mntl-sc-block_110-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading\"> <span class=\"mntl-sc-block-subheading__text\"> After the 1929 Crash </span> </h3>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_111-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> Regulatory measures were put into place to address the lack of government oversight that was considered to have led to the crisis that began in 1929. Among other things, the Securities Act of 1933 required financial institutions to provide investors with all significant information about securities being offered for sale. It also prohibited fraud in securities sales. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 established the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" data-component=\"link\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" data-ordinal=\"1\">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> and gave it significant power over the securities industry.

It created new government agencies with financial system oversight. The idea behind the act was to address the risky behaviors of financial institutions and the dearth of regulatory oversight that led to the crisis. One area of grave concern was the predatory mortgage lending that had occurred. Another focus was the stability of financial institutions. The act made it possible to liquidate or restructure firms, if necessary, to prevent the use of taxpayer funds to keep them afloat.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_115-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_116-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> The act\'s Volker Rule restricted the investing practices of banks and regulated derivative securities. It also set up the SEC Office of Credit Ratings to ensure that credit agencies henceforth issued appropriate ratings for institutions, rather than the fabricated favorable ratings that were part of the lead-up to the crisis.\n</p>\n<div id=\"mntl-sc-block_117-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block\"></div>\n<h3 id=\"mntl-sc-block_118-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading\"> <span class=\"mntl-sc-block-subheading__text\"> During the Trump Administration </span> </h3>\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_119-0\" class=\"comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html\"> The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act signed in 2018 by President Trump addressed criticisms of Dodd-Frank and rolled back some of its provisions.

And, when there’s something everyone needs, there’s a huge opportunity for investors.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"89v80\">About $9.8 trillion is spent on healthcare globally. Half of that amount -- around $4.9 trillion -- is spent in the U.S. With the healthcare sector growing significantly faster than the overall economy, the numbers will almost certainly be much larger by the end of the decade.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"3e5c7\">How can investors profit from this growth? Here’s what you need to know about investing in healthcare stocks.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"4fgc2\">The healthcare sector is so broad that there are several different kinds of healthcare stocks. Four of the most important types are:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"eh1uv\">Strong companies can be found within each type of healthcare stock. We’ll break down at least one example of each with a look at <b>Vertex Pharmaceuticals</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"206020\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/vrtx/\">VRTX</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.74%</span></span>), <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-intuitive-surgical-stock/\"><b>Intuitive Surgical</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204057\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/isrg/\">ISRG</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.99%</span></span>), <b>TransMedics Group</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"341301\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/tmdx/\">TMDX</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 1.83%</span></span>), <b>UnitedHealth Group</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"205890\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/unh/\">UNH</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.31%</span></span>), and <b>HCA Healthcare</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"225073\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/hca/\">HCA</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.53%</span></span>).</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"14u0m\">How do you find the absolute best healthcare stocks to buy? There are four key things to look for:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"akqa3\">The most important thing you’ll want to check out with any healthcare stock is the company’s growth prospects. Determine how quickly <a href=\"/terms/r/revenue/\">revenue</a> has grown in recent years. The future doesn’t always mirror the past. However, if a company hasn’t been able to deliver strong revenue growth so far, it probably won’t in the future.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"89osm\">Read the investor presentations on companies’ websites to learn their strategies for growth and the size of their potential markets. Check out the companies’ rivals to see if their strategies seem to be as good or better. Note that companies will often mention specific competitors by name in their <a href=\"/terms/0-9/10k/\">10-K annual regulatory filings</a> to the <a href=\"/terms/s/sec/\">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC).</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3n9ru\">Don’t overlook the possibility that <a href=\"/terms/m/mergers-and-acquisitions/\">mergers and acquisitions</a> (M&amp;A) could boost a company’s growth prospects. Companies that have grown through M&amp;A in the past could be looking for new deals to make in the future.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"29a8r\">Keep in mind that deals don\'t necessarily include an outright purchase of another company. Larger companies sometimes collaborate with smaller players instead of buying them. For example, Vertex Pharmaceuticals teamed up with small biotech <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-crispr-therapeutics-stock/\"><b>CRISPR Therapeutics</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"338676\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/crsp/\">CRSP</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 4.78%</span></span>). The two companies won U.S. regulatory approvals for <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/healthcare/genomics-stocks/gene-editing-stocks/\">gene-editing</a> therapy Casgevy in treating sickle cell disease in December 2023 and for treating transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia in January 2024. They\'re also working together to develop therapies targeting type 1 diabetes.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"qqu9\">The SEC filings also include statements that can help evaluate the financial strength of a company. Ideally, a company will already be profitable. If it isn’t, make sure you learn how it plans to achieve profitability and how quickly it expects to do so.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"83rf4\">A company’s cash position includes cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. It can be found on the <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/beginners-guide-financial-statements/balance-sheet/\">balance sheet</a> (a financial statement that lists all the company’s assets, <a href=\"/terms/l/liability/\">liabilities</a>, and shareholder equity) in the company\'s annual and quarterly regulatory filings. Think about cash position the same way you’d think about the amount of money in your checking, savings, and retirement accounts: The more, the better.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ctu1m\">Another important gauge of financial strength is the <a href=\"/terms/f/free-cash-flow/\">free cash flow (FCF)</a> generated by a company. FCF is the cash left over after operating expenses and capital expenditures (which includes money spent on buildings, equipment, and land). As with the cash position, the higher a company’s FCF, the stronger its financial position.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"csdob\">You’d want to know how much a new car is worth before buying it. Determining the value of a healthcare stock before buying it is also important so you can make sure you’re paying a fair price.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5va23\">There are quite a few valuation metrics. The <a href=\"/terms/p/pe-ratio/\">price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio</a> is the most popular and measures the price of a stock in relation to its earnings per share, or what you get in earnings for every dollar you invest.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"epojc\">Some P/E ratios are backward-looking, or reflecting earnings from a previous period (typically the past 12 months). <a href=\"/terms/f/forward-pe/\">Forward P/E ratios</a>, which use earnings estimates for one year into the future, can be more helpful in assessing the valuation of fast-growing healthcare stocks. Comparing P/E ratios with other stocks in the same industry will help you determine if the stock is relatively cheap or relatively expensive.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9n31s\">Just because a stock’s P/E ratio is higher than those of its peers doesn’t mean it’s a good or bad buy. It could indicate that the company’s growth prospects are much better than those of its rivals. Be sure to also check out the stock’s <a href=\"/terms/p/peg-ratio/\">price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio</a>, which incorporates projected earnings growth rates (typically over five years). Stocks with lower PEG ratios (especially when the ratios are less than 1) are more attractively valued than those with higher PEG ratios.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"e2h8e\">Some of the best healthcare stocks <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/\">pay dividends</a> -- a portion of earnings that the company returns to shareholders. Dividends can boost the overall return you receive from owning a stock.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"b8k9a\">The <a href=\"/terms/d/dividend-yield/\">dividend yield</a> tells you how large a stock’s annual dividend payments are as a percentage of the current share price. Consider the stock’s <a href=\"/terms/d/dividend-payout-ratio/\">payout ratio</a>, which measures dividends as a percentage of earnings and indicates how much of the company’s cash is being used to cover the dividend. The lower the payout ratio, the greater the likelihood that the company will be able to keep paying dividends in the future.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"9mq40\">Investing in any kind of stock comes with risks, including the possibility that competitors will develop more successful products and services. Healthcare stocks face these risks, as well as others that are more unique to the sector.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"822vo\">Healthcare is highly regulated. Drugmakers and medical device makers can fail to secure the necessary regulatory approvals to market new products. Regulatory changes can drastically alter a healthcare stock’s growth prospects. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees the regulation of drugs and medical devices. It’s smart to pay attention to any FDA action related to medical stocks you’re watching.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"a9nnd\">Many healthcare stocks also face significant litigation risk. For example, biopharmaceutical companies, medical device makers, and healthcare providers can be sued if patients think the companies’ products and services have caused them harm.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"cjpgn\">In addition, drugmakers and medical device makers must convince payers, including health insurers, PBMs, and government agencies, to buy their products. If companies aren’t successful in obtaining reimbursement approvals, their growth prospects can be reduced.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1fpi4\">Many healthcare companies are also highly dependent on <a href=\"/terms/m/medicare/\">Medicare</a> reimbursement levels. Recent changes to Medicare allow the program to negotiate prices for some high-cost drugs with pharmaceutical companies. Some drugmakers\' revenues and profits could be negatively affected as Medicare pays less for certain drugs.</p>\n                \n                \n<p>Healthcare is changing, and remote medicine is just one example. Check out these companies.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Learn how to invest in the growing industry of genomics and get a list of the field\'s most promising companies.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>The continued legalization of marijuana means growth for companies in this sector.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Health insurance is a necessity today, which means it\'s a great addition to your portfolio.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"537o7\">Despite these risks, the overall outlook for healthcare stocks appears very good over the long term. Aging demographic trends around the world, combined with advances in technology, should open up tremendous opportunities for healthcare stocks -- and provide healthy returns for patient investors.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"jqvg2\">Many healthcare stocks are good alternatives for investors to buy now. Some top candidates representing various areas of the healthcare sector include Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Intuitive Surgical, TransMedics Group, UnitedHealth Group, and HCA Healthcare.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"evuhk\">While investors must decide for themselves whether any sector is a good fit for them, healthcare could be a smart area in which to invest for many. Healthcare spending is growing faster than the U.S. GDP as the population ages. This should create significant opportunities for innovative healthcare companies.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"fni2b\">Many healthcare stocks perform relatively well during a <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/what-to-invest-in/recession-proof-stocks/\">recession</a>. Healthcare products and services are usually needed regardless of economic conditions. However, some healthcare stocks might be more affected by recessions than others.</p>\n      \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

Real estate investments can also help you diversify your portfolio and protect it from stock market volatility. Let’s look at the most popular options for investing in real estate, the pros and cons, and how you can get started.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"f22ij\"></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"co9ol\">Here are the most popular real estate investment methods:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"co48n\">Let\'s dive deeper into how these work.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8p26e\"><a href=\"/terms/r/rental-properties/\">Rental properties</a> are among the most hands-on options on this list. You buy a property and rent it to tenants, usually for one or more years. In addition, buying a vacation home and renting it for shorter periods on a platform such as <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-airbnb-abnb/\"><b>Airbnb</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"343379\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/abnb/\">ABNB</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -1.39%</span></span>) is becoming more popular.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"82slm\">As the property owner, you are the landlord. You’re responsible for upkeep, cleaning between tenants, repairs, and paying property taxes. Depending on the lease terms, you may be on the hook for replacing appliances and paying for utilities.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6qmno\">You make money off rental properties from the rental income you receive from tenants and price appreciation if you sell the property for more than you paid.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9o2qs\">You can also benefit from tax write-offs. Under <a href=\"/terms/p/passive-income/\">passive activity</a> loss rules, you can deduct as much as $25,000 of losses from your rental properties from your normal income if your modified <a href=\"/terms/m/modified-adjusted-gross-income/\">adjusted gross income</a> is $100,000 or less. The deduction phases out by $1 for every $2 of <a href=\"/terms/m/modified-adjusted-gross-income/\">modified adjusted gross income</a> above $100,000 until it completely phases out at $150,000. <a href=\"/terms/d/depreciation/\">Depreciation</a> (a noncash expense) and interest (which you pay no matter what) can make the property show an accounting loss even when you’re still making money.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"df8ju\">When you buy a rental property, you could need a down payment of as much as 25%. In addition, you might incur other startup costs like repairs and renovations. However, you\'ll earn income plus any price appreciation.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8eu6e\">People with limited available capital could consider a <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/real-estate-investing/basics/rental-arbitrage/\">rental arbitrage strategy</a>. You sign a long-term lease on a property of a year or more and rent it on the short-term vacation rental market. You pocket the difference between your expenses (including rent) and the rental income received.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"c0mgb\">If you don’t want to put up with the headache of managing a rental property or can’t come up with the down payment, <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/real-estate-investing/reit/\">real estate investment trusts (REITs)</a> are an easy way to start investing in real estate.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"c9ffd\">REITs are companies that own and manage rental properties. They can hold any type of commercial real estate, including medical office space, malls, warehouses, offices, or apartment buildings.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"sp4wh\">REITs tend to have high <a href=\"/terms/d/dividend-income/\">dividend payments</a> because they are required to pay out at least 90% of their net income to investors. If the REIT meets this requirement, it will not have to pay corporate taxes.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"gkgyn\">Additionally, while selling a rental property could take months and mountains of paperwork, a REIT has the advantage of <a href=\"/terms/l/liquidity/\">liquidity</a> since many REITs trade on a <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/exchange/\">stock exchange</a>.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"bc6gf\">Investing in a <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/real-estate-investing/basics/real-estate-investment-group/\">real estate investment group (REIG)</a> is one way to keep the profit potential of private rental properties while possibly getting more upside than a REIT trading at a premium <a>valuation</a> to the value of its portfolio.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"e65p4\">REIGs purchase and manage properties. They sell interests in the property to investors who get a share of the rental income.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2drr6\">The operating company receives a portion of the rent and manages the property. This means the company finds new tenants and takes care of all maintenance. REIGs often will retain some of the rent to pay down debt and meet other obligations if some units are vacant.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"fynez\"><a href=\"/research/house-flipping-statistics/\">Flipping houses</a> is the most hands-on, challenging, and risky of these options, but it can be the most profitable. The two most common ways to flip houses are to buy, repair, and sell, or buy, rehab, rent, refinance, and repeat (<a href=\"/terms/b/brrrr-method/\">BRRRR method</a>). In either case, the key is to limit your initial investment with a low down payment and keep renovation costs low.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"yqqbm\">Let’s say you buy a house for $250,000 with 20% down, or $50,000. You spend another $50,000 on renovations and then sell the house for $400,000. You use the $400,000 to pay off the $200,000 loan and then have $100,000 in profit on a $100,000 investment. It’s a great return if you can get it.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"c22ii\">The problem is that you usually can’t. Housing markets can flip from a sellers\' market to a buyers\' market on a dime, which can affect your sales price. Meanwhile, keeping renovation costs to a minimum may sound easy, but it may be nearly impossible if you don’t have direct construction experience. Inflation and delays can push costs through the roof.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"o6wth\">If you flip houses, do extensive due diligence. Also, make sure to build in a big cushion in case something doesn\'t go according to plan (which is usually the case).</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2ato0\">Real estate funds invest in REITs and real estate operating companies (REOCs). REOCs are like REITs, but they don’t have to pay dividends, so they grow much faster.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bl5cv\">Real estate <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/mutual-funds/\">mutual funds</a> or <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/\">exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a> are the simplest ways to invest in real estate. Many have very low minimum investments (for example, Fundrise lets you invest in its real estate funds for only $10, while many <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/real-estate-investing/reit/reit-etf/\">REIT ETFs</a> cost less than $100 per share). The fund\'s managers pick real estate stocks or property investments that generate income, allowing you to passively collect dividend income.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9mnj6\">Even if you’re a stocks-only investor, consider using real estate funds to get <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/portfolio-diversification/\">diversification</a> while keeping the liquidity profile you’re used to. Investors have many high-quality REIT ETF options.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"545n4\">Here are a few pros and cons of investing in real estate:</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"4tv90\">If you choose to invest directly in real estate through a rental property or fix-and-flip, follow these five steps to get started:</p>\n<p>These often slow and steady stocks can create wealth over time.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>From homebuilders to REITs to suppliers to planned communities, there are plenty of smart ways to invest in the housing market.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>This commodity is essential to construction and homebuilding.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>You need a land survey to determine property lines. But what do they cost?</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"36aio\">Real estate investing can seem intimidating at first. Not everyone has the time or ability to flip houses or handle having a tenant. The good news is there are options available for every level of investor, with each catering to different goals, skill levels, and time constraints. That allows anyone to get started today and let the wealth-creation potential of real estate investing begin.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"dpkbe\">Yes, it can be worth getting into real estate investing. Real estate has historically been an excellent long-term investment (<a href=\"/research/reits-vs-stocks/\">REITs have outperformed stocks</a> over the very long term). It provides several benefits, including the potential for income and property appreciation, tax savings, and a hedge against inflation.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"hp0o3\">Depending on the strategy, $5,000 can be enough to invest in real estate. Many real estate strategies have investment minimums well below $5,000. For example, you can invest in many REITs and REIT ETFs with a few hundred dollars or less. Meanwhile, some real estate funds have investment minimums of $5,000 or less.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7b44d\">However, you\'ll likely need more than $5,000 to buy a rental property or invest in a house to fix and flip due to all the upfront costs of acquiring a property (down payment and real estate closing costs) and expenses to renovate the property or hold it until you rent it out.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"hp0o3\">The easiest way to begin investing in real estate is to buy shares of a REIT or real estate fund. You can get started for only $10 in some cases (Fundrise has a $10 minimum investment). You can steadily invest more as you have additional money to invest to grow your real estate portfolio.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"hp0o3\">The 2% rule in real estate is a popular guideline for determining whether a rental property would make a good investment. The rule states that the property should generate monthly rental revenue of at least 2% of the purchase price. For example, if you are considering a rental property that costs $250,000 to buy, it should generate at least $5,000 in rental income each month.</p>\n      \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

It performs three main functions:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"38ted\">Industrial companies operate in several subsectors of the economy, providing products and services related to:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"jc7or\">The industrial industry is one of three economic segments. It\'s also known as the secondary sector. The other two economic segments are the primary sector, encompassing <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-staples/agriculture-stocks/\">agriculture</a>, fishing, and <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/materials/mining-stocks/\">mining</a>, and the service sector, which includes <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/hospitality-stocks/\">hospitality</a>, consultancy, and nursing.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"owtbj\">These industrial stocks offer some of the sector’s best durable long-term investments:</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"eqdtm\"><b>Waste Management</b>, or WM, is one of the leading waste management companies in North America. It provides waste collection, transfer, and disposal services, as well as recycling and resource recovery. The company is also a leading developer and operator of landfill gas-to-energy facilities.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"d21oe\">It provides its services to residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers. With demand for waste hauling relatively stable, its business is more <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/what-to-invest-in/recession-proof-stocks/\">recession-resistant</a> than other industrial companies.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ao947\">Over the years, WM has invested to automate its collection truck fleet and convert it to run on cleaner, cheaper <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/natural-gas-stocks/\">natural gas</a>. Moves like these have allowed WM to consistently generate free cash flow, giving it the funds to make acquisitions. In late 2024, it acquired Stericycle to expand its comprehensive environmental solutions into the growing healthcare sector.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"cigob\">The company also routinely returns money to shareholders via <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/\">dividends</a> and <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/share-repurchase/\">share repurchases</a> while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet. This strategy of expanding and also rewarding shareholders has enabled Waste Management to create significant shareholder value over the years.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"75jdl\"><b>FedEx</b> provides customers with transportation, e-commerce, and business services. The company operates a fleet of aircraft and vehicles, logistics facilities, and <a href=\"/terms/b/what-does-brick-and-mortar-mean/\">retail stores</a> that help facilitate the shipment of millions of packages daily. It also offers businesses a host of other <a href=\"/terms/l/logistics-in-business/\">logistics</a> and e-commerce services that help to distribute their products to customers.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"2jv21\">FedEx produces lots of <a href=\"/terms/f/free-cash-flow/\">free cash flow</a>, which allows the company to pay a competitive and growing dividend. It can also repay debt to strengthen its <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/beginners-guide-financial-statements/balance-sheet/\">balance sheet</a> and make investments to expand its operations.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"698kg\">FedEx’s strong cash flow also enables the company to invest in innovation. The shipping company is testing autonomous vehicles and delivery services. It’s also making <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/esg-investing/\">sustainability-related investments</a>. FedEx aims to become carbon-neutral by 2040 while generating compelling investment returns for its shareholders.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"4tg50\"><a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-lockheed-martin/\"><b>Lockheed Martin</b></a> is a leading global security and aerospace company. It researches, designs, develops, and manufactures advanced technology systems, products, and services, primarily for government customers. The defense contractor has four main business segments: aeronautics, missiles and fire control, rotary and mission systems, and <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/industrials/space-stocks/\">space</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"c61pv\">The company invests billions of dollars annually on <a>research and development (R&amp;D)</a> to advance the latest defense technology. It routinely complements its internal R&amp;D program with acquisitions. In late 2024, the company acquired Terran Orbital to enhance its space capabilities.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"88s72\">The defense contractor should continue growing in the coming years. Recent wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have increased global defense spending. That trend will likely continue as geopolitical tensions remain high.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"tni6\"><b>Caterpillar</b> is a leading global manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives. The company has three operating segments: construction industries, resource industries, and energy and transportation. It also provides financing and related services.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2t6i1\">Caterpillar is working toward making more sustainable equipment. It’s collaborating with companies in the rail, energy, mining, and technology sectors on developing new technologies with lower carbon emissions. For example, it’s working on both battery- and <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/hydrogen-stocks/\">hydrogen</a>-powered locomotives. It’s also developing zero-emission haul trucks and equipment for the mining industry. The focus on sustainability will be a major growth driver for Caterpillar in the coming years as the global economy continues making progress on reducing carbon emissions.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"c010g\">Another major growth driver for Caterpillar is the increasing investment on <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/industrials/construction-stocks/infrastructure-stocks/\">infrastructure</a> in the coming years. The U.S. is one of many countries that has boosted its spending on projects to maintain and expand highway and rail systems, bridges, and other infrastructure. The increased spending should drive more demand for construction equipment.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"8unf0\"><a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-ge-vernova-stock/\"><b>GE Vernova</b></a> is an energy equipment manufacturing and services company. It formed in 2024 after the once-mighty industrial giant GE completed its breakup. GE Vernova is the former GE Power and GE Renewable Energy businesses.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"94t36\">The company has three business segments:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3fhmu\">GE Vernova\'s products currently produce about 25% of the world\'s electricity. It manufactures turbines (natural gas and wind), positioning it to grow as demand for lower carbon energy rises. It also services its turbines for customers, providing the company with very stable cash flow.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"dqtr8\">The strongest industrial companies have diversified operations, low operating costs, and investment-grade credit <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/bonds/bond-ratings/\">ratings</a>. Diversification, a low cost structure, and access to affordable debt are important because of the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/cyclical-stocks/\">cyclicality</a> of the industrials sector. Economic downturns directly reduce the demand for industrial goods and services.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"a632v\">Industrial companies also need access to affordable debt because their operations are often very capital-intensive. Most industrial companies need to borrow money to buy new capital equipment and build new manufacturing facilities. Another benefit of a low-cost structure is less exposure to rising cost pressures in <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/inflation/\">inflationary</a> environments.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"dnp7d\">While a company\'s financial performance is always relevant for investors, companies in the industrial sector need to maintain particularly strong financial positions. Prospective investors should pay close attention to how specific industrial companies fare in times of crisis.</p>\n                \n                \n<p>As the U.S. continues fortifying its defense budget, the defense industry\'s most promising stocks look more appealing.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Explore investing opportunities in the transportation industry &amp; learn how these stocks can help you create a balanced portfolio.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>From defense applications to amateur photography, drones -- and drone stocks -- are flying onto investors\' radars.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Investing in exchange-traded funds of industrial companies is a way to play this vital sector.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"svps8\">The industrial sector\'s cyclical nature makes industrial company stocks better suited for risk-tolerant investors. As we’ve seen many times over the years, economic conditions can significantly change almost overnight. But in a booming economy, industrial company stocks can generate impressive returns for investors. <a href=\"/terms/b/buy-and-hold-strategy/\">Buy-and-hold</a> investors who are comfortable with volatility can often earn strong returns by owning shares of high-quality industrial companies for the long term.</p>\n                \n                \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

They include daily essentials such as food and beverages, personal care products, and household and home care products.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"efb3o\">People buy consumer staples regardless of the state of the economy, and the amount they buy is relatively fixed in good times and bad. In this way, the consumer staples <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/\">sector</a> behaves much differently than <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/\">consumer discretionary businesses</a> such as restaurants, hotels, and apparel, or <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/consumer-durables-stocks/\">consumer durables</a>, which are long-lasting products such as furniture and electronics.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"dvc9i\">Consumer staples companies may not have the highest earnings growth or year-over-year revenue growth because these stocks tend to be large, mature companies, and the categories they compete in are typically developed. Historically, the sector has experienced relatively little disruption, and these stocks make up for modest growth with low price volatility, reliable profits, <a href=\"/terms/d/dividends-per-share/\">dividends</a>, and defensive positioning.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"riud\">Consumer staples stocks typically sell consumer goods that people use every day. These include everything from groceries, paper products, and cleaning products to over-the-counter health products, tobacco, and cosmetics. They are sometimes called fast-moving consumer goods, and the sector is also referred to as consumer defensive. These are products that are frequently consumed and turn over quickly in stores. They are also defensive because consumers buy them regardless of the state of the economy. Consumer staples are needs rather than wants.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2f7ig\">Consumer staples stocks include both the companies that make these products and the retailers that primarily sell them like supermarkets.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"99oc\">Consumer staples stocks function in a noncyclical manner, meaning they offer investors safety during <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/what-to-invest-in-recession/\">recessionary climates</a>. Since these companies sell goods such as food and cleaning products that consumers rely on regardless of the state of the economy, they tend to generate solid profits even in weak economies. For instance, a number of consumer staples companies thrived during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic as consumers stocked up on essentials and avoided spending on discretionary purchases such as <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/travel-stocks/\">travel</a> and <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/restaurant-stocks/\">restaurant</a> meals.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"4htgl\">Consumer staples stocks also tend to be dividend payers, and many of them are even <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/dividend-kings/\">Dividend Kings</a>, having raised their dividend payout every year for 50 years or more. That shows these companies tend to have longevity -- many of the best-known consumer staples stocks have been around for 100 years or longer -- and they\'re capable of steadily growing profits over a long period of time.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"lasde\">Consumer staples are noncyclical, meaning they offer investors safety during recessionary climates.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"lp2n3\">Because of their reputation for reliable dividends, consumer staples stocks are often popular with retirees and other investors seeking long-term income and security. Many offer better dividend yields than an <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/sp-500/etfs/\"><b>S&amp;P 500</b> ETF</a>, which currently pays a dividend yield of roughly 1.2%.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8ehcg\">Because consumer staples companies operate in stable sectors and sell products that are always in demand, the biggest ones have been around for a century or more. Their longevity is a reflection of their brand strength, their history of acquiring smaller brands, and their ability to endure a wide range of challenges and economic cycles.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"65qh7\">One important factor to monitor when looking at a consumer staples company is its ability to pass on cost increases. Although this issue often takes center stage during <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/inflation/\">inflationary periods</a>, it is always an important component of growth. Simple price increases, changing packaging sizes, and production innovation are all vital tactics in the industry. In inflationary periods, costs for ingredients, labor, and distribution often rise faster than a company’s ability to pass on price changes. There can be a period of margin weakness that will likely be temporary for the best-managed consumer staples companies. Price increases also need to be balanced against the risk of consumers trading down to cheaper alternatives.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"ebkjg\">Just as you’re familiar with many consumer staples products, you’ll likely be familiar with many of the top stocks in the sector, such as <b>Procter &amp; Gamble</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204975\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/pg/\">PG</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.67%</span></span>), <b>PepsiCo</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204965\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/pep/\">PEP</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.69%</span></span>), <b>Philip Morris</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"210565\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/pm/\">PM</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.17%</span></span>), and <b>Costco Wholesale</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"203178\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/cost/\">COST</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.26%</span></span>).</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ebn8d\">Procter &amp; Gamble is best known for its marquee brands such as Tide, Gillette, and Crest. The household and personal care company is almost 200 years old. A large number of its brands hold the No. 1 or No. 2 market share position in their categories, including paper products, laundry detergent, diapers, and beauty products. P&amp;G is also a Dividend King.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6l89r\">P&amp;G has recently developed a number of innovative products, including the nontoxic insect repellent Zevo; a dye-free, silicone-free, and sulfate-free version of Head &amp; Shoulders called Head &amp; Shoulders BARE; and Spruce, a weed killer, that cuts of the weed\'s water supply on contact. Spruce is P&amp;G\'s first entry into the large lawn care category.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"eub98\">P&amp;G has performed during an inflationary era since it can pass along price increases to its customers, although its growth has slowed down recently. For fiscal 2025, as of its third-quarter earnings report, the company is targeting 2% organic sales growth and 2% to 4% core earnings per share growth. Given the uncertainty around <a href=\"/terms/t/tariffs/\">tariffs</a> and weakening consumer sentiment, that still shows the company\'s ability to grow in challenging environments.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"20kvm\"><a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-pepsi-stock/\">PepsiCo</a> is much more than its namesake beverage brand. The <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-does-pepsi-own/\">company also owns</a> Frito-Lay and Quaker, as well as popular drink brands such as Mountain Dew and Gatorade. Its Frito-Lay snack business generates almost as much revenue in North America as its beverages, and that business has been a source of growth while soda sales have slowed in the U.S. and around the world. With its global brands and distribution, Pepsi enjoys many of the same advantages as industry giants P&amp;G and <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-staples/beverage-stocks/\">beverage company</a> competitor <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-coca-cola-stock/\"><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204186\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/ko/\">KO</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.06%</span></span>).</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bipvu\">Because of its exposure to the restaurant industry, Pepsi is subject to demand in the consumer discretionary channel, but with the help of the strength of its brands, it\'s been able to capitalize on inflation by raising prices and growing profits. For example, in 2024 organic revenue rose 2%, driving core <a href=\"/terms/e/earnings-per-share/\">earnings per share</a> (EPS) up 9%.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1ua7m\">Pepsi has also grown through acquisitions. In 2018, it acquired SodaStream, which gave the company a leading position in countertop soda-making. It also bought energy drink maker Rockstar Energy in 2020. Earlier in 2025, it acquired Siete Foods, a maker of grain-free tortillas and Mexican-American foods, and Poppi, a prebiotic soda brand.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7h66f\">PepsiCo recently became a Dividend King, having raised its quarterly payout for 50 years in a row, which shows that it’s an attractive stock for income investors.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2ti1l\"><b>Philip Morris</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"210565\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/pm/\">PM</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.17%</span></span>) is one of the three global tobacco giants, but the company has the strongest position of the three. Philip Morris was formed when <b>Altria</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204556\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/mo/\">MO</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.63%</span></span>) and Philip Morris split in 2008 with Altria retaining the domestic business, while Philip Morris took the international markets.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"80tc7\">That\'s proven to favor Philip Morris as international <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-staples/tobacco-stocks/\">tobacco</a> markets have been much more resilient than the U.S., where smoking has been steadily declining for decades.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bsgnc\">In addition to its exposure to more smoking-friendly markets, Philip Morris has also outperformed peers like Altria and <b>British American Tobacco</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"203008\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/bti/\">BTI</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 1.03%</span></span>) in next-gen, smoke-free products, which now make up more than 40% of Philip Morris\' revenue and a higher percentage of its <a href=\"/terms/g/gross-profit/\">gross profit</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7cgfe\">The company has found success in IQOS, its heat-not-burn tobacco sticks, which uses tobacco rather than the e-liquid vapes use, and heats to a temperature where it turns into vapor rather than smoke. As of the end of 2024, there were more than 32 million IQOS users worldwide, and the number was growing. The company launched IQOS in the U.S. March 2025.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"4leng\">Additionally, the company\'s acquisition of Swedish Match in 2023 has paid off, giving it ownership of the popular Zyn oral nicotine pouches, whose shipments jumped 53% to 223.4 million cans in the first quarter of 2025. Philip Morris is also expanding production at its Kentucky Zyn facility and adding a new one in Colorado.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6pcko\">Finally, Philip Morris offers a reliable <a href=\"/terms/d/dividend-yield/\">dividend yield</a> of 3%.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"a8hop\"><a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-costco-stock/\">Costco Wholesale</a> has been one of the best-performing consumer staples stocks on the market in recent history.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"33o04\">Unlike the other stocks on the list, Costco doesn\'t make products for other retailers to sell. Instead, as a retailer of primarily consumer staples, more than half of its sales come from groceries.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8cjvk\">Costco also has many of the components of a consumer staples stock that consumers look for, including a business model built around its reputation for bargain prices on bulk goods. Its membership model adds another layer of resilience since most of its profits come from membership fees. Customers typically renew memberships at a rate around 90%.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"eplrg\">The retailer continues to open new stores and has been delivering solid comparable sales growth and e-commerce growth.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"elrq7\">Costco also has a track record of rewarding investors with special dividends every three to five years, which makes up for its paltry dividend yield at 0.5%.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"3gdnt\">For investors who prefer exposure to the entire consumer staples sector rather than picking individual stocks, buying shares in an <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/\">exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF) is the most sensible option. The chart below shows three consumer staples ETFs:</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"r2oh6\">All three ETFs have Procter &amp; Gamble as their No. 1 holding. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola show up in the top six while turning up lower down on two of the three lists. The iShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF doesn\'t include <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/retail-stocks/\">retailers</a>, but the other two ETFs have giants such as <b>Walmart</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"206096\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/wmt/\">WMT</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.69%</span></span>) and Costco making the cut.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"dh20m\">In addition, all three ETFs own popular consumer staples stocks such as:</p>\n<p>Agribusiness is big business. These companies are its leaders.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>The companies that make the foods we eat can also produce investment opportunities.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Carrying everything from water to natural gas, companies here can be a low-risk investment.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Clothing is a basic staple. These companies are the industry leaders.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"m366f\">The best consumer staples companies tend to have consistently strong organic sales, leading market shares, and attractive dividend yields. Although the industry sees relatively little innovation and growth, consumer staples products tend to be timeless, and these companies are likely to continue to endure.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"cib79\">Consumer staples companies have an excellent ability to <a href=\"/research/stock-performance-recessions/\">withstand recessions</a>, increase their dividends, and post consistent, incremental growth. All of those characteristics make them good choices for investors looking for reliable, <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/income-stocks/\">income-producing stocks</a>.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"6h3tk\">FAQ</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"zve1m\">It\'s impossible to predict the short-term movements of the market, but investors tend to favor consumer staples stocks during times of uncertainty since they generally outperform in weak economies due to their defensive positioning.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"z8m58\">Determining the average annual return of consumer staples depends on how you define the sector and which stocks you choose. Based on the history of the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP), consumer staples stocks have compounded at a 7% rate with dividends reinvested since 1998.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"w0vw3\">Whether you should have consumer staples in your portfolio will depend on your investing style. If you are a risk-averse investor or a retiree looking for reliable dividend income, then investing in consumer staples makes sense.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"e72cp\">If you\'re a growth-oriented, risk-seeking investor, you\'ll probably favor other sectors over consumer staples.</p>\n      \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

They can do this while still producing excellent appreciation over the long run.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"av7r0\">An index fund is an investment that tracks a financial <a href=\"/terms/i/index/\">index</a>, such as the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/sp-500/\"><b>S&amp;P 500</b></a> or <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/nasdaq/\"><b>Nasdaq Composite</b></a>. Index funds can be found for broad stock market indexes. There are also more narrowly focused stock indexes, indexes that invest in <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/\">specific sectors</a> or types of stocks, and indexes that focus on <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/what-to-invest-in/fixed-income-investments/\">fixed-income</a> investments like bonds, just to name a few. There are hundreds of great index funds available.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6ojq6\">Index funds generally invest in all the components of the <a href=\"/terms/b/benchmark/\">benchmark index</a> they track.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"60pmp\">If you\'re looking for some index fund ideas to help you invest better, these four are a good place to start. All of these are broad index funds that could help form a solid backbone for your investment portfolio.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6ub9g\">It\'s worth noting that the annual costs mentioned here, which are technically known as expense ratios, aren\'t actual out-of-pocket costs you pay. They are the fund\'s various management fees and are reflected in the share price of the index fund over time.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bcjsl\">Also, you might notice that this list includes four Vanguard ETFs, and there\'s a good reason for it. Vanguard funds have low expenses and are widely regarded as an easy entry point for <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/\">new index fund investors</a>, but you can find similar funds from other providers as well.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6ejfa\">The bottom line is that by allowing you to form a stock and bond <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/what-to-invest-in/asset-allocation/\">asset allocation</a> that is appropriate for your <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/risk-tolerance/\">risk tolerance</a> and <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/how-to-set-investment-goals/\">investment goals</a>, index funds like these let you create a portfolio without the need to research individual stocks or pay an expensive investment advisor.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"be9hs\">Once you\'ve used index funds like these to establish a backbone to your portfolio, you can then explore some more focused and specialized index funds to add over time.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"peg69\">There are hundreds of indexes you can track using index funds.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bgapn\">The most popular index to invest in is the S&amp;P 500 index. This includes the stocks of 500 of the largest U.S. companies and is widely considered the best gauge of how the overall U.S. stock market is doing. Here\'s a short list of some additional top indexes, broken down by the part of the market that they cover:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"e2r4q\">In addition to these broad indexes, you can find sector indexes tied to specific industries. For example, you can buy an index fund that tracks the financial sector.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"e8m5f\">There are several other types of index funds. You can find country indexes that target stocks in specific international markets. You can also find style indexes emphasizing fast-growing companies or <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/value-stocks/\">value-priced stocks</a>, as well as other indexes that limit their investments based on their own filtering systems.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"7tl5f\">Once you\'ve chosen an index, you can generally find at least one index fund that tracks it. For popular <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/index-funds/best-sp-500-index-funds/\">indexes, like the S&amp;P 500</a>, you might have a dozen or more choices, all tracking the same index. If you have more than one fund option for your chosen index, you\'ll want to ask some basic questions.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"c4713\">First, out of the top index funds that meet your needs, which <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/index-funds/low-cost-index-funds/\">index fund has the lowest costs</a>? Even a seemingly small difference can have a big impact over the long term.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3c7lk\">You can determine which index fund is more cost-effective by comparing the expense ratios of two or more index funds.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6lsur\">Second, are there any limitations or restrictions on an index fund that prevent you from investing in it? For example, many <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/index-funds/index-funds-vs-mutual-funds/\">mutual fund</a> index funds have minimum investment requirements.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3fac2\">The answers to those questions should make it easier to pick the right index fund for you.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"23qfn\">You can <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/money/buying-stocks/\">open a brokerage account</a> that allows you to buy and sell shares of the index fund that interests you. Index funds come in both <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/etf-vs-mutual-fund/\">exchange-traded fund (ETF) and mutual fund</a> forms.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"17lku\">While you could open an account directly with a fund provider, most investors prefer to have all their investments held in a single brokerage account. Plus, many brokers allow customers to buy <a href=\"/terms/f/what-are-fractional-shares/\">fractional shares</a> of index funds in ETF form. This can allow you to start investing and create a diversified portfolio without needing thousands of dollars right away.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"ntpb8\">Investing in index funds is one of the easiest and most effective ways for investors to <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/how-to-build-wealth/\">build wealth</a>. By simply matching the impressive performance of the financial markets over time, index funds can turn your investment into a huge nest egg in the long run -- and best of all, you don\'t have to be a <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/\">stock market</a> expert to do it.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"neca2\">Investors find index funds especially useful for many reasons:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"84kcb\">As simple as index funds are, they\'re not for everyone. The downsides of investing in index funds include the following:</p>\n<p>These 8 top index funds pay dividends, too. Learn more about these potential investments.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Smaller companies can add up to big returns, and these index funds track them.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Crypto, a volatile investment; index funds, a stable, long-term play. How can they work together?</p>\n          \n        \n<p>If you\'re just getting started investing, these basics can help guide you.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"9c0ap\">If you have the time, knowledge, and desire to <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/portfolio-investment/\">create a portfolio</a> of individual stocks, by all means, go for it. But index funds can be a great wealth-building tool all by themselves.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"f9f18\">Index funds offer investors of all skill levels a simple, time-tested way to invest. Plus, they can be a nice backbone to any stock portfolio, even for the most experienced and knowledgeable investors.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2j65e\">If you\'re interested in growing your money but would rather put some or all of your investments on autopilot, index funds can be a great solution to achieve your financial goals.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"mwg72\">While nobody knows what the stock market will do over the short term, it almost always goes up over long periods. The best way to invest in index funds is to invest steadily over time, so now could be a great time to get started, regardless of what the funds do in the short term.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"mwg72\">Yes, you can sell your shares of an index fund whenever you want. If you own them in a standard (taxable) brokerage account, you can withdraw your money at any time. If they are in retirement accounts, like IRAs, age-based withdrawal restrictions can apply.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"mwg72\">You can keep your money invested in an index fund for as long as you want. It\'s possible to buy and sell shares of index funds in a matter of seconds, but they are best suited as long-term investments held for many years to build wealth.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"v25cf\"><a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/index-funds/how-index-funds-work/\">Index funds</a> are a special type of financial vehicle that pools money from investors and invests it in securities, such as stocks or bonds. An index fund is designed to track the returns of a designated <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/\">stock market index</a>. A market index is a hypothetical portfolio of securities representing a market segment. For example, the S&amp;P 500 index represents 500 of the largest U.S. companies.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"pnh2j\">The long-term and short-term performance of index funds vary dramatically based on the focus of each one. For context, the <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/index-funds/average-return/\">average annual return</a> for the S&amp;P 500 is around 10% over the long term.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"9drhr\">Low-cost index funds have minimal management expenses, allowing investors to keep more of their gains. Here are some top low-cost index funds and their expense ratios (current as of June 2025):</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"lt9cf\">You can directly invest in index funds by opening and funding a brokerage account. All brokers allow you to buy shares of ETFs on the open market, and most allow you to directly invest in mutual funds if you prefer to use those.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"lt9cf\">The minimum needed depends on the fund and your broker\'s policies. If your broker allows you to buy <a href=\"/terms/f/what-are-fractional-shares/\">fractional shares</a> of stock, you may be able to invest in index fund ETFs with as little as $1. If not, your minimum investment will be the cost of one share of the ETF. Index funds that are mutual funds typically have a minimum initial investment set by the mutual fund provider.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"xk9fz\">Index funds come in ETF and mutual fund forms and can be invested in directly through a brokerage account. Alternatively, you can automate your index fund investing by opening an account with a <a href=\"/terms/r/robo-advisor/\">robo advisor</a>.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"9w1py\">Index funds can be an excellent way to get exposure to the stock market without excessive fees or depending too much on any individual stock\'s performance. They can be a great way for beginning investors to get started, but they can also serve as a core of any stock portfolio, regardless of the investor\'s level of experience.</p>\n      \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

So, it\'s not surprising that many investors don\'t know where to begin. With the stock market well below its highs, plenty of stocks are still extremely attractive for long-term investors to buy right now.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"eenud\">But what are the best stocks to buy in June 2025? Although I can\'t consult a crystal ball that tells me what stocks will deliver the best returns, I\'ve tried to do the next best thing. In this article, I\'ll discuss 10 stocks that I think could be great buys for long-term investors looking to put their money to work.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"bu5uu\">Before we get to the stocks, let\'s acknowledge three caveats:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3jgdp\">Now, let\'s get to my list of the 10 best stocks to <a href=\"/terms/b/buy-and-hold-strategy/\">buy and hold</a> for the long term -- listed from smallest <a href=\"/terms/m/market-cap/\">market cap</a> to largest as of June 2025 -- followed by the summarized buy thesis for each.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"89s45\">Now that you\'ve seen my top 10 best stocks to buy now, you may be wondering why I picked each company. Here\'s a quick rundown of why I\'m such a fan of each as a long-term stock to invest in.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"w1cra\"><a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/who-owns-paypal/\">PayPal</a> is an absolute cash machine that has been beaten down by more than 75% from its highs.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8u68c\">The main reason for its decline is that investors were disappointed when PayPal\'s growth abruptly slowed down in 2022, and management conceded that its previous user growth targets were unrealistic.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3muff\">However, it\'s important for investors to realize that this is still a strong and highly profitable business and that it is in the early stages of a turnaround that is already showing signs of progress.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6fbvc\">If you aren\'t familiar with it, PayPal completely overhauled its management team in late 2023. Every member of its C-suite is new to the business, and it is an impressive group. The new leaders are already making some big moves, including rolling out an industry-leading cash-back debit card product and launching an advertising platform. Since new leadership took over, efficiency has improved dramatically, and <a href=\"/terms/e/earnings-per-share/\">earnings per share</a> (EPS) is significantly higher.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"m7k5\">The company has 436 million active users between PayPal and Venmo, and it processes about $1.7 trillion in annualized payment volume. The company produces about $6 billion in <a href=\"/terms/f/free-cash-flow/\">free cash flow</a> annually and has been aggressively <a href=\"/terms/b/buybacks/\">buying back</a> its own stock with it, a sign management thinks it\'s cheap.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"epnim\">It\'s not hard to see why PayPal\'s management is choosing to use its capital this way. As of June 2025, the stock traded at a historically low <a href=\"/terms/p/price-to-sales-ratio-value-stocks/\">price-to-sales ratio</a> and for just 14 times forward earnings.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"crihr\"></p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"w1cra\">Few companies have been as successful in disrupting an entire industry as <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-airbnb-abnb/\">Airbnb</a>. The company started in 2007 as a few air mattresses on the floor of the co-founders\' apartments (that\'s where the company gets its name) and has evolved to the point where it has changed the way millions of people look at <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/travel-stocks/\">travel</a> accommodations.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"su0i\">Airbnb has more than 5 million hosts who list more than 8 million properties and experiences on its platform. In the most recent quarter alone, more than 143 million nights and experiences were booked on Airbnb\'s platform, with a total booking value of almost $25 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8mgi\">Airbnb is not only massive and growing fast, but it is highly profitable. It generated $4.4 billion in <a href=\"/terms/f/free-cash-flow/\">free cash flow</a> (FCF) and has a 39% FCF margin over the past four quarters.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7lsek\">Looking forward, Airbnb has $11.5 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet and still has a massive growth opportunity. Its overall market opportunity is estimated to be trillions of dollars when we include short-term stays, long-term stays, and experiences. Plus, management clearly thinks the stock\'s valuation doesn\'t reflect the long-term opportunity since the company has been buying back shares rather aggressively.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"w1cra\">It seems like every week, there\'s another high-profile security breach. The need for <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/cybersecurity-stocks/\">cybersecurity</a> solutions isn\'t getting any smaller. And that\'s especially true when it comes to cloud-based security.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7pros\">CrowdStrike is leading the charge to keep data secure in the <a href=\"/terms/c/cloud-computing/\">cloud</a>. Don\'t be fooled by the incident where a software update malfunction sent temporary shockwaves through the internet -- this is still a best-in-breed cybersecurity company with a highly effective platform.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"625ni\">CrowdStrike collects security data from each of its many users, analyzes it, and uses it to automate security throughout its entire network. This makes the platform highly effective at detecting the newest threats, and the more users adopt CrowdStrike\'s solutions (known as its Falcon platform), the more effective it becomes. The use of crowdsourced threat data and its leading market share give it a competitive advantage over peers.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"e9qgi\">With $4.4 billion in annual recurring <a href=\"/terms/r/revenue/\">revenue</a> and an 80% subscription gross margin, CrowdStrike\'s growth has been impressive, but this could be just the beginning. The company sees its current addressable market at $100 billion in potential revenue and expects that the opportunity could more than double to $225 billion by 2028.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"idtmc\">One of my favorite long-term stock investments in the market, MercadoLibre, is often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America, and for good reason. The company operates an <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/top-ecommerce-companies/\">e-commerce marketplace</a> with a dominant presence in some of the region\'s most populous nations, including Brazil and Argentina.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"d46f5\">However, there\'s a lot more to MercadoLibre. It operates a fast-growing <a href=\"/terms/a/ach-payment/\">payments platform</a> called Mercado Pago, a logistics service known as Mercado Envios, a business lending platform, and more.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"dsjub\">The marketplace saw $13.3 billion in merchandise volume in the first quarter of 2025, 17% more than the same quarter in 2024. Mercado Pago processes more than $230 billion in annualized payment volume, with three-fourths coming from outside the company\'s e-commerce platform.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"3022d\"></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8pee5\">Both main parts of the business are growing rapidly. And don\'t overlook Mercado Crédito, the company\'s young but fast-growing (and highly profitable) lending business. Mercado Crédito has $7.8 billion of outstanding loan balances and is growing rapidly.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8icn7\">MercadoLibre isn\'t just the Amazon of Latin America -- it\'s the Amazon, PayPal, <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-block-stock/\">Block</a> (Square) (<a href=\"/quote/nyse/sq/\">NYSE:SQ</a>), Shopify, and more all rolled into one. And it\'s in a much earlier stage of growth. As the e-commerce and fintech landscapes in Latin America evolve over the coming years, MercadoLibre could be a major long-term beneficiary.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bdefu\"><a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-shopify-stock/\">Shopify</a> operates a platform designed to allow businesses of all sizes to sell their products online, with a particular focus on empowering <a href=\"/terms/s/sme/\">smaller businesses</a> and growing with them by establishing long-term relationships.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"67gia\">Shopify offers a subscription plan starting at $39 per month for businesses (even less for one-person merchants) and many adjacent services that help businesses operate smoothly, such as payment processing solutions and logistics.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8uuep\">Shopify\'s \"one-stop shop\" approach to enabling e-commerce has turned it into a powerhouse. It now has more e-commerce sales flowing through its ecosystem than any company besides Amazon. However, Shopify could be just getting started.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8t350\">The platform has generated $9.4 billion in revenue over the past four quarters. However, this is just a fraction of its estimated $153 billion (and growing) market opportunity as more retailers shift their focus to online sales.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7ucds\">E-commerce is still in the relatively early stages, making up slightly more than 16% of retail sales in the United States. Shopify\'s platform has the No. 2 share of e-commerce by total payment volume (second only to Amazon), giving it a powerful ecosystem with <a href=\"/terms/n/network-effect/\">network effect</a> advantages over competitors.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"4lkpe\">The stock price is still well below the highs in the recent market downturn due to fears about recession and signs of a slowdown in consumer spending, and Shopify looks like a great long-term opportunity.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"bs1mq\">Robot-assisted surgery beats shaky human hands. That general thesis hasn\'t changed much from when I first noticed <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-intuitive-surgical-stock/\">Intuitive Surgical</a> stock in 2005. The da Vinci Surgical System is the clear market leader, and its \"razor and blades\" model helps Intuitive generate a recurring stream of revenue.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3brvf\">Intuitive Surgical is dominant in its space, with a global market share of about 80%. It has lots of room to grow as the adoption of its surgical systems and the number of supported procedures increase over time. This is particularly true in many international markets, where the implementation of <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/ai-in-healthcare/\">robot-assisted surgery</a> could be a long-tailed growth catalyst for this excellent business for decades to come.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8l3db\"></p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"45nb8\">The House of Mouse is like the all-weather tires of a portfolio. The pandemic hurt its theme park and movie businesses but helped the Disney+ streaming service, which has grown into a powerhouse years earlier than <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-disney-stock/\">Disney</a> expected.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bf18m\">In fact, barely five years after launching, Disney+ Core now has 126 million paid subscribers, while <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-hulu-stock/\">Hulu</a> adds tens of millions more. In addition, the market is absorbing price increases with minimal impact on the subscriber count, and Disney\'s streaming business recently became profitable for the first time ever.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ap8f\">While consumers are clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, demand for <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-does-disney-own/\">Disney\'s theme parks, movies, and cruise line</a> has been strong. In fact, per-guest revenue in Disney\'s parks is far greater than in comparable pre-COVID-19 pandemic times due to initiatives that have driven higher in-park spending. Plus, the company announced it will invest $60 billion over the next 10 years in its theme parks and cruise line to make sure they stay full for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"fb43q\">With Disney also laser-focused on the profitability of Disney+ and its other <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/media-stocks/streaming-service-stocks/\">streaming platforms</a>, Hulu and ESPN+, this could be a powerful combination of profitable all-weather revenue streams. In a nutshell, Disney might be the ultimate combination of an in-person experiential stock and a tech-focused growth business.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"cogec\">Disney\'s amazing stable of intellectual properties (the Marvel Cinematic Universe, <i>Star Wars</i>, ESPN, Pixar, etc.) and cash-machine theme park business give it a margin of safety that makes it perhaps the safest stock on this list. And it still maintains tremendous profit growth potential as the newer areas of its business evolve.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"myy0c\">Although most of this list is made up of <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/growth-stocks/\">growth stocks</a>, or at least stocks that have some exciting growth drivers, this is the relatively boring <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/value-stocks/\">value pick</a> of the bunch (but in the best possible way).</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3cv3\"><a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-berkshire-hathaway-stock/\">Berkshire Hathaway</a> owns a collection of about 60 subsidiary businesses, including household names such as GEICO, Duracell, and Dairy Queen, just to name a few. Berkshire also owns a portfolio of common stocks worth about $285 billion as of June 2025 that includes massive stakes in <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-apple-stock/\"><b>Apple</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"202686\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/aapl/\">AAPL</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.53%</span></span>), <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-bank-of-america-stock/\"><b>Bank of America</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"202908\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/bac/\">BAC</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.52%</span></span>), <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-chevron-stock/\"><b>Chevron</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"203255\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/cvx/\">CVX</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.03%</span></span>), <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-american-express-stock/\"><b>American Express</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"202897\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/axp/\">AXP</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.23%</span></span>), and <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-coca-cola-stock/\"><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204186\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/ko/\">KO</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.06%</span></span>), as well as positions in dozens of other companies. Many were particularly savvy investments, such as the Bank of America stake, which resulted from a <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/preferred-stocks/\">preferred stock</a> deal made in the wake of the financial crisis.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9pdh0\">In addition to its businesses and stock portfolio, Berkshire also had about $348 billion in cash and short-term investments as of March 31, 2025, giving it incredible financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"fsh6e\">Berkshire continues to produce market-beating returns in most years despite its massive size. And while Berkshire certainly won\'t produce the roughly 5,550,000% return (not a typo) it has produced from the time Buffett took the helm in 1964 through the end of 2024, there\'s no reason to believe it won\'t continue to outpace the <b>S&amp;P 500</b> (<a href=\"/quote/snpindex/^gspc/\">SNPINDEX:^GSPC</a>) index for the foreseeable future. In fact, the company recently reached an impressive milestone by becoming the first non-technology company to reach a trillion-dollar market cap.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3n1gq\">Legendary investor Warren Buffett recently announced his plans to step down as CEO at the end of 2025, but the company is in good hands. Berkshire\'s winning culture is likely to live on for decades, even in its post-Buffett era.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"myy0c\">Alphabet isn\'t exactly a household name, but its main subsidiary, Google, certainly is. And there\'s a lot more to the business and its potential than the massive internet search operation that has a dominant market share.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"95v6c\">Google is divided into two main segments -- Google Services and Google Cloud. Google services include YouTube, Google Play, Gmail, Android, Chrome, and the Nest smart-home products. This part of the business makes most of its money from advertising, but there\'s also significant revenue from hardware (Nest) and in-app purchases (Google Play).</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"c02m1\">Google Cloud is the company\'s cloud services division and has the No. 3 market share behind Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft\'s Azure. Google Cloud has been growing its market share in recent years, and the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/cloud-stocks/\">cloud infrastructure market</a> itself is forecast to quadruple in size by 2030. So, while this makes up about 10% of the company\'s revenue today, it could be the biggest growth driver for years to come.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"16i20\">In addition, Alphabet has a segment called \"other bets,\" which owns several promising early-stage businesses. The <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-waymo-stock/\">Waymo</a> self-driving vehicle technology company is perhaps the most notable. While none of the \"other bets\" companies produce any significant revenue yet, there\'s lots of long-term potential.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ad5ui\">Not only is there tons of growth potential, but Alphabet is extremely profitable and has tons of cash. In fact, this recently prompted Alphabet to start paying a dividend for the first time ever.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5vqv6\"><a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-amazon-stock/\">Amazon</a> doesn\'t really need much of an elevator pitch for most people. The company has a dominant lead in the U.S. e-commerce market. And its Amazon Web Services cloud platform is also a market leader, with a significant lead over the other two large players in the space, <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-microsoft-stock/\"><b>Microsoft</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204577\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/msft/\">MSFT</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.26%</span></span>) and <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-google-stock/\">Alphabet</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1hg8f\">However, more growth potential exists than you might think. We\'re still a long way from maximizing e-commerce adoption; it only accounts for a little more than 16% of all U.S. retail sales. The cloud industry is relatively young and expected to roughly quadruple in size to a $2.3 trillion market by 2032. Amazon also has a ton of potential in other areas, such as <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/healthcare/\">healthcare</a>, <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-staples/food-stocks/\">grocery stores</a>, neighborhood markets, and more.</p>\n                \n                \n<p>ETFs can help eliminate risk because they tend to be less volatile than individual stocks and give exposure to a range of assets.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Find out why bonds are getting a lot of attention from investors these days.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Looking to the long term? Get in on these index funds.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>When is it time to exit your position in a stock? Consider these factors.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"81ig4\">If you\'re just starting out on your investing journey (or want a sanity check), please read through our guide on how to invest in stocks (mentioned above). It goes through all the basics, from how to get started to how to determine your <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/investment-strategies/\">personal investing strategy</a> to how much of your money to invest in stocks.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"4hl6c\">Although I\'m bullish on each of these stocks and think they are good stocks to buy right now, they might not all be the best choices for investors without established and <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/portfolio-diversification/\">diversified portfolios</a>. Even the most stable companies on this list aren\'t immune to volatility in their stock prices, especially over short periods.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"f6g64\">For this reason, if you\'re just getting started, you\'ll also want to see our list of the <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/beginner-stocks/\">five top tips for investing in stocks for beginners</a>. To be sure, I think the 10 stocks discussed here are some of the best long-term stock investments you can buy now. But it\'s wise to start with the stocks that speak to you and feel free to ignore the ones that don\'t.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"oop21\">The top 10 stocks to buy depend on many factors, such as current stock market conditions, your personal investment goals and risk tolerance, and much more. Generally speaking, the best stocks to buy are leaders in their industries with lots of room to grow and durable competitive advantages.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"xf2wa\">Some of the top stocks to invest in right now are Amazon, Alphabet (parent of Google), Disney, and Berkshire Hathaway. However, the best stocks <i>for you</i> depend on your personal investment objectives.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"xf2wa\">Unfortunately, nobody has a crystal ball that will tell them what the best-performing stock will be, and we are no exception. But if you buy strong businesses with durable competitive advantages, you\'ll set yourself up for long-term success.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"xf2wa\">The best-performing stocks tend to be those whose management teams consistently innovate and execute on their growth strategies, handily outperforming expectations in the process.</p>\n      \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

To name a few examples, buying stocks, investing in a rental property, and even putting money into a certificate of deposit at your bank are all forms of investing.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7l9am\">When done the right way, investing can be an extremely reliable way to <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/how-to-build-wealth/\">build wealth</a> over time. But how should you get started? What is the best way for you to put your money to work?</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ckqte\">If you\'re a new investor, or an experienced one who wants to invest <i>better</i>, we\'re here for you. It\'s time to make your money work for you.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"w9r9x\">Before you put your money into the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/basics/\">stock market</a> or other investments, you\'ll need a basic understanding of how to invest your money the right way. Unfortunately, there\'s no one-size-fits-all answer here.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"all1i\">The best way to invest your money is the way that works best <i>for you</i>. To figure that out, you\'ll want to determine your investing style, budget, and <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/risk-tolerance/\">risk tolerance</a>. So, let\'s take those one at a time.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"fbmsv\">There are more reasons why investing is important that we can realistically list here. But to name some of the most important:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1fprt\"><b><i>How much time do you want to put into investing your money?</i></b></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"11i2n\">The investing world has two major camps when it comes to how to invest money: <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/active-vs-passive-investing/\">active investing and passive investing</a>. Neither is a clear winner. Both can be great ways to build wealth as long as you focus on the long term and aren\'t just looking for short-term gains. That said, your lifestyle, budget, risk tolerance, and interests might give you a preference for one type.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8jpv3\">Active investing means taking time to research your investments and constructing and maintaining your portfolio on your own. In simple terms, if you plan to buy and sell individual stocks through an <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/money/buying-stocks/\">online broker</a>, you\'re planning to be an active investor. To successfully be an active investor, you\'ll need three things:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"a62ke\">It\'s also important to understand what we <i>don\'t</i> mean by active investing. Active investing doesn\'t mean buying and selling stocks frequently, it certainly doesn\'t mean <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/day-trading/\">day trading</a>, and it doesn\'t mean buying stocks because you think they will go up over the next few weeks or months.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"3aqsb\"><a href=\"/terms/p/passive-income/\">Passive investing</a> is the equivalent of an airplane on autopilot. You\'ll still get good results over the long run and with far less effort. In a nutshell, passive investing involves putting your money to work in investment vehicles where someone else does the hard work.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"eseja\"><a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/mutual-funds/\">Mutual fund investing</a> is an example of this strategy, as are <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/etfs-to-buy/\">exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>. Alternatively, you can hire a financial or investment advisor or use a <a href=\"/terms/r/robo-advisor/\">robo-advisor</a> to design and implement an <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/investment-strategies/\">investment strategy</a> on your behalf. All of these are ways to invest without doing too much research and with minimal ongoing time commitment to managing your portfolio.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"b8m4w\"><i>More simplicity, more stability, more predictability</i></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"s65el\"><i>More work, more risk, more potential reward</i></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"b34a9\"><b><i>How much money do you have to invest?</i></b></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"hb9dd\">You may think you need a large sum of money to start a portfolio, but you can <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/how-to-invest-100-dollars/\">begin investing with $100</a>. We also have great ideas for <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/how-to-invest-1000-dollars/\">investing $1,000</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"c29oo\">In fact, many of today\'s stock trading platforms will let you get started with as little as $1.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8nrer\">Here\'s the point: The amount of money you\'re starting with isn\'t the most important thing. The big question is whether you\'re financially ready to invest and to invest frequently over time.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"0a3cm\">One important step to take before investing is to establish an <a href=\"/terms/e/emergency-fund/\">emergency fund</a>. This is cash set aside in a form, such as a <a href=\"/terms/s/savings-account/\">savings account</a>, that makes it available for quick withdrawal.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7b2bu\">Most investments, whether stocks, mutual funds, or <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/real-estate-investing/\">real estate</a>, have some level of risk. You never want to be forced to divest (or sell) these investments in a time of need. The emergency fund is your safety net to avoid this.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"9ih29\">Most financial planners suggest an ideal amount for an emergency fund is enough to cover six months of your expenses. Although this is certainly a good target, you don\'t need this much money set aside before you can start investing.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"12j5\">At first, the goal is to avoid having to sell your investments every time you get a flat tire or some other unforeseen expenses pop up. A more achievable target might be having $1,000 set aside before you invest, since this would make you better prepared than most Americans for unplanned expenses. It\'s also smart to get rid of any high-interest debt (like credit cards) before investing.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"25jot\">Think of it this way: The stock market has historically produced <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/returns/\">returns</a> of 9% to 10% annually over long periods, depending on the time frame you\'re viewing. If you invest your money at these types of returns and pay your creditors 24% interest (roughly the average credit card interest rate in June 2025), you\'ll put yourself in a position to <i>lose</i> money over the long run, even if your investments perform well.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"fufbg\"><b><i>How much financial risk are you willing to take?</i></b></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"d6ib4\">Not all investments are successful. Each type of investment has its own level of risk, but this risk is often correlated with returns.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6t7qo\">It\'s important to find a <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/balanced-portfolio/\">balance</a> between maximizing the returns on your money and finding a comfortable risk level. For example, high-quality <a href=\"/terms/b/bond-funds/\">bonds</a>, such as Treasury bonds, offer predictable returns with very low risk. But they also have relatively low returns (between 3.9% and 5% as of June 2025), depending on the maturity term you choose and the current interest rate environment.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"agilk\">By contrast, stock returns can vary widely depending on the company and time frame. However, the overall stock market has historically produced <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/average-stock-market-return/\">average returns</a> of almost 10% per year.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"c989e\">There can be huge differences in risk, even within the broad categories of <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/beginner-stocks/\">stocks</a> and bonds. For example, <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/bonds/treasury-bonds/\">Treasury bonds</a> or AAA-rated <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/bonds/corporate-bonds/\">corporate bonds</a> are very low-risk investments. However, they pay relatively low interest rates. Savings accounts represent an even lower risk but offer less reward.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"bvqh8\">On the other hand, a high-yield bond can produce greater income but will come with a greater risk of default. In the world of stocks, the spectrum of risk between <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/blue-chip-stocks/\">blue chip stocks</a>, like <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-apple-stock/\"><b>Apple</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"202686\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/aapl/\">AAPL</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.53%</span></span>), and <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/penny-stocks/\">penny stocks</a> is enormous. One good solution for beginners is to use a robo-advisor to formulate an <a href=\"/terms/i/investment-thesis/\">investment plan</a> that meets your risk tolerance and financial goals.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"974on\">In a nutshell, a robo-advisor is a service offered by a brokerage. It will construct and maintain a portfolio of stock- and bond-based <a href=\"/terms/i/index-fund/\">index funds</a> designed to maximize your return potential while keeping your risk level appropriate for your needs.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3ut6a\"><b><i>How do you decide where to invest your money?</i></b></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9lsri\">This is a tough question; unfortunately, there isn\'t a perfect answer. The best type of investment for you depends on your <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/how-to-set-investment-goals/\">investment goals</a> and risk tolerance. But with the guidelines discussed above in mind, you should be far better positioned to decide <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/what-to-invest-in/\">what to invest in</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"e7vi2\">For example, if you have a relatively high risk tolerance, along with the time and desire to research individual stocks (and learn how to do it right), that could be the best way to go. If you have a low risk tolerance but want higher returns than you\'d get from a savings account, <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/bonds/\">bond investments</a> (or bond funds) might be more appropriate.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9mrgd\">If you\'re like most Americans and don\'t want to spend hours on your portfolio, putting your money in passive investments like <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/index-funds/index-funds-vs-mutual-funds/\">index funds</a> or mutual funds can be a smart choice. And if you <i>really</i> want to take a hands-off approach, a robo-advisor could be right for you.</p>\n<p>Are you ready to jump into the stock market? We\'ve got you. Build long-term wealth using The Motley Fool\'s market-beating method.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Do you want long-term growth potential while still being able to sleep at night? Check out these index funds.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>So, what do you do to build wealth if you find yourself with extra cash?</p>\n          \n        \n<p>While many are worried that AI might eventually take their jobs, others are looking to harness its power to make money.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"01ptl\">Investing money may seem intimidating, especially if you\'ve never done it before. However, if you figure out how you want to invest, how much money you should invest, and your risk tolerance, you\'ll be well positioned to make smart decisions with your money that will serve you well for decades to come.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"3tvdv\">Before you start investing money, you need to determine your budget and risk tolerance. That is, are you willing to take on more risk for the potential of superior returns, or is your main priority to make sure you don\'t lose money?</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"datjs\">Then, you can determine your investment style and decide whether you should buy <a href=\"/terms/s/stock/\">individual stocks</a> or use passive investment vehicles like <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/etf-vs-mutual-fund/\">exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds</a>. Once you\'ve decided on all that and done some investment research, you can open a brokerage account and get started.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"rk4h9\">The time horizon of your investment depends on your goals. For example, if you plan to use the money to put your kids through college in a few years, you\'ll have a different length than if you\'re investing for retirement in a few decades.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"rk4h9\">You don\'t need much money to get started with investing. Some of the top stock trading platforms will let you get started with as little as $1, and if they offer <a href=\"/terms/f/what-are-fractional-shares/\">fractional share</a> investing, you can put your money to work immediately.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"g1rvg\">There are many ways you can invest money, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), <a href=\"/terms/c/certificate-of-deposit/\">certificates of deposit (CDs)</a>, savings accounts, and more. The best option for you depends on your particular risk tolerance and financial goals.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"3tvdv\">There are several beginner-friendly ways to invest. You can open a brokerage account and buy passive investments like index funds and mutual funds. Another (even easier) option is to open an account with an automated investing app -- also known as a robo-advisor -- which will use your money to create an appropriate portfolio of investments.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"kxw0y\">Over time, the stock market has produced annualized returns of 9% to 10%, although performance can vary dramatically from year to year. On the other hand, <a href=\"/terms/f/fixed-income/\">fixed-income investments</a>, like bonds, have historically generated 4% to 6% per year but with far less volatility.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"kxw0y\">There are plenty of ways to invest $1,000 to make more money. If you don\'t want to spend a ton of time researching and planning investments, opening an account with a robo-advisor (an automated investment platform) or buying ETFs or mutual funds could be a smart way to go.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"4onn3\">Alternatively, if you want to own individual stocks, $1,000 can be enough to create a diversified portfolio. That\'s especially true if your broker allows you to buy fractional shares of stock.</p>\n      \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

The Motley Fool reaches millions of people every month through our premium investing solutions, free guidance and market analysis on Fool.com, personal finance education, top-rated podcasts, and non-profit The Motley Fool Foundation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mb-8 text-lg font-bold uppercase\">Key Points</p>\n            \n<p data-block-key=\"kp7oh\">Most of us are used to borrowing money in some capacity, whether it\'s mortgaging our homes or bumming a few bucks off a friend. Similarly, companies, municipalities, and the federal government borrow money, too. How? By issuing bonds.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"598ua\">Bonds are a way for an organization to raise money. Let\'s say your town asks you to invest a certain amount of money. In exchange, your town promises to pay you back that investment, plus interest, over a specified period of time.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5s0nj\">For example, you might buy a 10-year, $10,000 bond paying 3% interest. In exchange, your town will promise to pay you interest on that $10,000 every six months and then return your $10,000 after 10 years.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"b61ku\">There are two ways to make money by investing in bonds. The first is to hold those bonds until their maturity date and collect <a href=\"/terms/i/interest-rates/\">interest payments</a> on them. Bond interest is usually paid twice a year.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3rhd8\">The second way to profit from bonds is to sell them at a price that\'s higher than you initially paid.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"74ua3\">For example, if you buy $10,000 worth of bonds at face value -- meaning you paid $10,000 -- and then sell them for $11,000 when their market value increases, you can pocket the $1,000 difference.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"b9lch\">Bond prices can rise for two main reasons. If the borrower\'s credit risk profile improves so that they\'re more likely to be able to repay the bond at maturity, then the price of the bond typically rises. Also, if prevailing interest rates on newly issued bonds go down, then the value of an existing bond at a higher rate goes up.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6qqth\">Yields, or the interest rate a bond pays, and bond prices tend to have an inverse relationship, meaning they move in opposite directions. If prevailing interest rates increase, prices for existing bonds are likely to fall because the coupon it offers is less valuable compared to new bonds.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"f8jnu\">In 2022 and 2023, the <a href=\"/terms/f/federal-reserve/\">Federal Reserve</a> aggressively hiked interest rates to fight inflation. Bond yields went up as a result, which also means that bond prices generally went down. As inflation came down, the Fed began lowering rates, leading to lower bond yields.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5hm2u\">Not all bonds pay interest. Some bonds, known as <a href=\"/terms/z/zero-coupon-bond/\">zero-coupon bonds</a>, offer a return once they\'ve matured. Because these bonds don\'t pay interest, they are usually sold for a deep discount to their face value.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"84ml\"><a href=\"/terms/b/bond-funds/\">Bond funds</a> take money from many different investors and pool it for a fund manager to handle. Usually, this means the fund manager uses the money to buy an assortment of individual bonds. Investing in bond funds is even safer than owning individual bonds.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3482r\">Bonds come in a variety of forms, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8n19i\">Unlike stocks, most bonds aren\'t traded publicly but trade <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/exchange/otc-markets/\">over the counter</a>, which means you must use a broker. Treasury bonds, however, are an exception. You can buy those directly from the U.S. government at <a href=\"https://www.treasurydirect.gov\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TreasuryDirect</a> without going through a middleman.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9h2e7\">The problem with this system is that investors have a harder time knowing whether they\'re getting a fair price because bond transactions don\'t occur in a centralized location. A broker, for example, might sell a certain bond at a premium (meaning above its face value). Thankfully, the <a href=\"/terms/f/finra/\">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority</a> (FINRA) regulates the bond market to some extent by posting transaction prices as that data becomes available.</p>\n                \n                \n<p>Find out why bonds are getting a lot of attention from investors these days.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>A T-bill is a short-term government debt security that doesn\'t pay interest, so calculating its return is slightly different.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Are you ready to jump into the stock market? We\'ve got you. Build long-term wealth using The Motley Fool\'s market-beating method.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Make money by identifying growth stocks, companies poised to grow faster than the market or average business in its industry.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"aqnha\">It makes sense to buy bonds when you want a fixed-income investment or need to reduce risk and volatility in your portfolio. Here are some situations when investing in bonds could be a good choice:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1m55d\">If you\'re the risk-averse type who truly can\'t bear the thought of losing money, bonds might be a more suitable investment for you than stocks.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1igof\">If you\'re heavily invested in stocks, bonds are a good way to diversify your portfolio and protect yourself from <a href=\"/terms/s/stock-market-volatility/\">market volatility</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"fuqvp\">If you\'re near retirement or already retired, you may not have the time to ride out <a href=\"/terms/b/bear-market/\">stock market downturns</a>, in which case bonds are a safer place for your money. In fact, most people are advised to shift away from stocks and into bonds as they get older. It\'s not terrible advice, provided you don\'t make the mistake of dumping your stocks completely in retirement.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"d9hx4\">A municipal bond is a debt issued by a state or municipality to fund public works. Like other bonds, investors lend money to the issuer for a predetermined period of time. The issuer promises to pay the investor interest over the term of the bond (usually twice a year) and then return the principal back to the investor when the bond matures.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"1vbzr\">A Treasury bond is debt issued by the U.S. government to raise money. Technically speaking, every kind of debt issued by the federal government is a bond, but the U.S. Treasury defines the Treasury bond as the 30-year note. Generally considered the safest investment in the world, U.S. Treasury securities of all lengths provide a nearly guaranteed source of income and hold their value in just about every economic environment.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"r8rbm\">A corporate bond is a debt instrument issued by a business to raise money. Unlike a stock offering, with which investors buy a stake in the company itself, a bond is a loan with a fixed term and an interest yield that investors will earn. When it matures, or reaches the end of the term, the company repays the bond holder. </p>\n      \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

There are 11 different stock market sectors, according to the most commonly used classification system, known as the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS).</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1mrup\">We categorize stocks into sectors to make it easy to compare companies that have similar business models.

It generally includes two different types of investments related to real estate. Some stocks in the sector are responsible for developing new real estate projects and then managing them by obtaining tenants for various spaces within the project property. In addition, most <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/real-estate-investing/reit/\">real estate investment trusts</a>, or REITs (pronounced REETS), which are special tax-favored business entities that operate in various areas of the real estate industry, get counted within the real estate sector.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"cs7ga\">Among the top stocks in the real estate sector, you\'ll find cellular communications tower specialist <b>American Tower</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"202813\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/amt/\">AMT</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.2%</span></span>) and major shopping mall owner and operator <b>Simon Property Group</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"205554\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/spg/\">SPG</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.95%</span></span>).</p>\n                \n                \n<p>Before you put down hard-earned cash, start with a basic understanding of how investing works -- and how to avoid rookie mistakes.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>There\'s a lot to unpack about student loans, so here\'s a guide to get you started.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Issued by the U.S. government to raise money, T-bonds should have a place in your portfolio.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"7ht3w\">If you are interested in a certain sector but are not ready to invest in a specific company within that sector, you can still participate in sector investing. Seek out lower-risk investments like <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/\">exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs) and <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/mutual-funds/\">mutual funds</a> that are specifically tied to a sector. For example, if you aren\'t comfortable evaluating health care stocks but want exposure in your portfolio, an <a href=\"/terms/i/index-fund/\">index fund</a> that tracks the sector could be the best way to go. Sector investing plays an increasingly important role in the strategies that investors use today.</p>\n                \n                \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

It then uses the trained system to make inferences about new data it\'s never seen.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"vn7rs\">The simplest example is a system designed to detect objects in images. Images containing those objects are provided to the system, which \"learns\" how to detect them in other images. The more objects it detects in images, the more accurate the detection system becomes.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9jtc9\">Companies employ AI in two main ways. Many tech companies use it to make their existing operations more powerful through high-profile applications like <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/robotics-stocks/\">robotics</a>, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants. AI is used by <b>Alphabet</b> subsidiary (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"203768\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/googl/\">GOOGL</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -1.17%</span></span>) (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"288965\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/goog/\">GOOG</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.65%</span></span>) <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-google-stock/\">Google</a> to filter spam in Gmail, by <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-amazon-stock/\"><b>Amazon</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"202816\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/amzn/\">AMZN</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.86%</span></span>) to recommend products to customers, and by <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-netflix-stock/\"><b>Netflix</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204654\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/nflx/\">NFLX</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.08%</span></span>) to guide content creation and recommendations.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1nlrk\">More recently, <a href=\"/research/chatgpt-investing/\">OpenAI\'s ChatGPT</a> has shown how far <a href=\"/terms/g/generative-ai/\">generative AI</a> -- a division of artificial intelligence capable of generating texts, images, sounds, and ideas -- has come. It can answer questions directly, write poems, and has even passed bar and medical exams. It has spawned a wave of new generative AI chatbots, including Anthropic\'s Claude, Alphabet\'s Gemini, and Meta AI from Meta Platforms. The potential is enormous.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"203gt\">Some companies also profit directly from AI by selling hardware, software, services, or expertise that the technology requires. These are true AI stocks and include those listed and described below.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"dnr1a\">Leading <a href=\"/terms/g/gpu/\">graphics processing unit</a> (GPU) company <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-nvidia-stock/\"><b>Nvidia</b></a> has taken advantage of the AI boom, with its GPUs becoming the de facto standard in data centers worldwide. Generative AI\'s <a href=\"/terms/a/ai-training/\">training</a> phase demands a lot of computing power; the phase that follows, the <a href=\"/terms/a/ai-inference/\">inference</a> phase, typically requires less. Graphics processing unit (GPU) chips, which were once used primarily for rendering video games, support both phases well. Nvidia\'s ambition is now beyond GPUs, aiming to build AI factories or <a href=\"/terms/d/data-center/\">data centers</a> full of Nvidia components to run AI applications and programming.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ele2i\">Nvidia\'s data center business now makes up the vast majority of the company\'s revenue, thanks to the emergence of generative AI. Because it sells the building blocks for AI infrastructure, Nvidia became the first major company to see a significant revenue boost from AI. Revenue surged through 2023 and 2024, and the stock has soared as well; in November 2024, it was briefly the most valuable company in the world. In 2024, full-year revenue jumped 114% to $130.5 billion, driven by the surge in data center demand.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ooo4\">Its chips are popular for running demanding workloads that applications like <a href=\"/terms/l/large-language-models/\">large language models</a> require. The pure-play <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/semiconductor-stocks/\">chip stock</a> is now selling its new Blackwell platform, which major cloud infrastructure services are deploying in 2025, and demand is outstripping supply.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5pu68\"><a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/automotive-stocks/self-driving-car-stocks/\">Self-driving cars</a> and \"physical AI\" are another area of focus. Nvidia develops hardware and software platforms that can power driver-assistance features and fully autonomous driving, which could be a significant source of revenue if that industry takes off. Automotive revenue is only a small fraction of the company\'s revenue, but that could change.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"aqd9f\">With Tesla launching its robotaxi network in Austin, the autonomous vehicle race appears to be heating up, and that should be good news for the semiconductor sector.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"efvpp\">A <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/automotive-stocks/self-driving-car-stocks/\">self-driving car</a> must process massive amounts of data from multiple sensors and cameras in real time, detect objects such as pedestrians and other vehicles, and make complex decisions. They require tremendous computing power, which is exactly what Nvidia\'s platform delivers.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"cmbou\">Its professional visualization segment, which includes its omniverse, also has a lot of potential in AI. Nvidia\'s chipsets could someday be supplanted by more specialized processors designed for AI, but the company is in an enviable position for now.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"8bp2d\">Alphabet has been preparing for the AI revolution for years, acquiring the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014. It\'s also among the leaders in autonomous vehicles through its <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-waymo-stock/\">Waymo</a> subsidiary, which is now ferrying passengers in its driverless cars in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7mr4e\">Alphabet launched <a href=\"/terms/g/google-gemini/\">Gemini</a>, its own AI chatbot and the latest iteration in its competition with ChatGPT, which some see as a threat to Google Search. So far, concerns about a challenge to its search dominance seem to have been overblown as Alphabet\'s ad revenue continues to grow steadily. It said that its Gemini 2.5 has been \"widely recognized as the best model in the industry.\"</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"b2jgk\">With information at the heart of its business, it\'s unsurprising that the company has prioritized AI. It\'s rolled out AI tools for Google Cloud and Google Workspace, including a generative AI assistant that helps write emails. Even its customer acquisition strategy in the cloud is based around AI -- the company has targeted AI start-ups for its cloud infrastructure service.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"625pf\">AI also plays a role in improving its search engine and YouTube, where it can pinpoint a relevant section of a video and direct users straight to it.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"4mjv7\">Finally, Alphabet is ramping up spending on capital expenditures with plans to spend $75 billion on AI infrastructure and related needs in 2025.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"53iif\"><a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-microsoft-stock/\"><b>Microsoft</b></a> has gotten a lot of buzz lately thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. The tech giant began investing in the tech start-up in 2019 and invested another $10 billion in OpenAI following the launch of ChatGPT.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6jfk0\">Microsoft has incorporated GPT features across its product portfolio, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service, Edge web browser, Office productivity software suite, and Copilot for Microsoft 365. Azure OpenAI has seen a particularly strong uptake, now counting more than 65% of the Fortune 500 as customers.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bgt5u\">CEO Satya Nadella has repeatedly said that he sees AI as the next major computing platform, and the reported $13 billion <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-openai-stock/\">investment in OpenAI</a> is a sign of the company\'s conviction in AI and its belief that it needs to lead that transition or get left behind as it did with mobile.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"13cen\">More recently, Microsoft has begun diversifying away from OpenAI, adding both internal and third-party models to products like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure, including <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-deepseek-stock/\">DeepSeek\'</a>s R1. The long-term implications for its relationship with OpenAI are unclear, but Microsoft seems to think it\'s wise to hedge its bets in the AI race.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ee420\">Microsoft is also harnessing the power of AI in other ways, including automated clinical documentation in healthcare to reduce paperwork and administrative needs. It\'s also using Azure to allow customers to build custom AI tools.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"fmtfk\">The company launched Azure AI Foundry in November 2024, which allows its customers to create and manage AI apps and agents. As of April 2025, developers at more than 70,000 companies are using it.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"48gb0\">CoreWeave, which had its <a href=\"/terms/i/ipo/\">initial public offering</a> (IPO) in March 2025, may be the closest thing to a pure-play AI stock on the market, and it was the first major AI IPO.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5c082\">Its cloud infrastructure platform was designed specifically for AI, and it counts customers like Nvidia, OpenAI, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft as part of its core customer base. In fact, Nvidia and OpenAI are both investors in the company.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"beprl\">CoreWeave has grown at an incredible pace over the last three years, going from generating almost nothing in revenue in 2022 to $1.9 billion in revenue in 2024. From 2022 to 2024, revenue grew by more than 100 times.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2mh0n\">CoreWeave\'s business is risky since Microsoft accounted for 62% of its revenue, meaning the business would suffer significantly if Microsoft pulled back on spending with the platform. In its first quarter 2025 report, CoreWeave said that no single company accounted for more than half of its backlog, a sign that its customer concentration is improving.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"jvai\">If you\'re looking for direct exposure to AI, CoreWeave is a good option since essentially all of its revenue is driven by the demand for computing power to run generative AI programs.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"461sm\"></p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"dbv5d\">Unlike the other big tech companies on this list, Meta Platforms doesn\'t have a cloud computing business, but the company is investing just as much in AI as peers like Alphabet.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9m8qo\">Meta AI, the company\'s chatbot that\'s available on its apps like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, had almost 600 million monthly active users as of December 2024, and it continues to update its Llama large language model, which is now up to Llama 4.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6grn1\">It\'s also allowing its advertisers to use AI creative tools for things like background and video generation and ad copy. AI is also involved in ad targeting, and the company aims to fully automate advertising with AI by 2026.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"11jl5\">Additionally, the company is incorporating AI in its hardware division, including its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which offer a built-in camera, open-ear audio, and a range of hands-free features. Its Meta Quest headsets are also connected to Meta AI, allowing users to tap into the power of AI through those headsets.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"4pni1\">Management sees AI at the core of its business and driving its transformation across areas like advertising, experiences, and devices.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"ducuq\">All the stocks above use machine learning technologies, but if you\'re looking for more options, here are two others worth considering:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"99pn0\"><a href=\"/terms/d/deep-learning/\">Deep learning</a> is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. It\'s the most advanced kind of AI and is crucial in technologies like self-driving cars. Deep learning is advancing in areas such as preventive healthcare, where predictive algorithms are necessary. It differs from machine learning in that it doesn\'t require human input.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"b47h7\">Nvidia is among the companies closely associated with deep learning. Its GPU chips use deep learning to power data centers and enable autonomous driving and cloud computing, among other functions.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2k3e3\">Alphabet has exposure to deep learning through a number of its businesses, including its autonomous vehicle start-up, Waymo. It also owns DeepMind, a deep learning platform that can diagnose eye diseases, predict the shapes of proteins, and accelerate the scientific discovery process.</p>\n                \n                \n<p>An in-depth look at the top artificial intelligence (AI) ETFs in the U.S. stock market this year.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Software as a service has been a growth driver in the tech industry.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>An in-depth look at the best quantum computing stocks in the U.S. stock market this year.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Learn how to invest in Elon Musk\'s space exploration company.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"zxqvq\">According to International Data Corporation, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to grow from $235 billion in 2024 to more than $631 billion in 2028.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"m84dy\">While the AI market is already large and still growing quickly, plenty of companies can profit from AI. Although picking stocks in a growth industry comes with a lot of uncertainty, these top AI stocks are all worth considering.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"v9wfc\">Artificial intelligence is a fast-moving technology, and AI stocks will likely be volatile as the sector evolves. AI stocks that have attracted the most attention include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but finding the best stock to buy is also a matter of price and valuation, which changes quickly.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"5sazy\">Nvidia has jumped into the lead among semiconductor companies in making AI chips and accelerators, and it has the competitive advantages to help it stay there. The <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/semiconductor-stocks/\">semiconductor sector</a> can also be highly cyclical, and pricing can change rapidly. Additionally, there\'s the potential for unexpected surprises like the DeepSeek launch, which sent AI stocks like Nvidia plunging. If Nvidia can maintain its lead in AI chips, the stock should continue to be a winner, but it will likely be volatile since the AI landscape is still developing.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"ayyae\">Currently, the biggest company that has made AI central to its business model is Nvidia, with a <a href=\"/terms/m/market-cap/\">market cap</a> that soared past $3 trillion at one point. The tech giant is at the center of the AI revolution as its components are fueling AI applications and are in high demand by major cloud infrastructure companies and others.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"1iz74\">Artificial intelligence is likely to shake up the economy and the business world, creating opportunities in the stock market. Whether AI is good for investing will depend on the company, but there will be winners from the new technology.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"ulj78\">Currently, Nvidia is broadly considered the leader in AI technology. The company has a monopoly-like market share in the data center GPU market, and its revenue has more than tripled since ChatGPT launched. Nvidia isn\'t guaranteed to remain the leader, though. Competition is on the way, and new technologies can change quickly.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"xws1p\">Tech giants aren\'t feeling a significant threat from start-ups yet, but there are some signs that competition is on the rise. Alphabet stock, for example, fell when Apple said it was considering making AI search engines available on Safari, directly competing with Google.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bfhpe\">The tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft also show that start-ups could begin to pose more of a threat to the \"<a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/magnificent-seven/\">Magnificent Seven</a>\" stocks, though they are unlikely to derail their growth.</p>\n      \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

That makes it an important industry for investors to know about.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"us9fc\">Demand for materials is <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/cyclical-stocks/\">cyclical</a>, making the sector\'s participants highly susceptible to changes in the economy. If economic conditions weaken, demand for basic materials tends to decline, lowering prices and affecting profitability for materials producers.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"akc5h\">The economic cycle, however, is only one of many factors that can affect the materials sector. Supply chain issues, legislation, and <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/inflation/\">inflation</a> are just some of the other factors that can affect demand, prices, and industry profitability for <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/\">the materials sector</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8qt67\">In 2022, a new headwind emerged in the sector in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The war disrupted the global supply chain for materials because the region produces vital metals for making steel and exports minerals for fertilizer, such as potash. The supply issues drove up prices of most basic materials, greatly affecting the sector and the broader economy.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"jvd0\">Although many companies operate in the materials industry, the following four stand out as some of the top materials stocks for investors to consider:</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"2c8n9\"></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"203c1\">Rio Tinto is one of the world\'s leading <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/materials/mining-stocks/\">mining companies</a>. The London-based company produces the three top industrial metals -- <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/materials/metal-stocks/iron-stocks/\">iron ore</a>, <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/materials/metal-stocks/aluminum-stocks/\">aluminum</a>, and <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/materials/metal-stocks/copper-stocks/\">copper</a> -- and several other important metals and minerals.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"klmn\">Rio Tinto focuses on these industrial metals because they are the ones the global economy most commonly consumes. The uses for iron ore, aluminum, and copper are numerous and growing:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1rhmu\">Although these metals are highly sensitive to cyclical changes in the global economy, demand for the metals Rio Tinto produces should continue to grow.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9vk2s\">The company also boasts a strong balance sheet and some of the lowest-cost operations in the world. It has the financial flexibility to expand its operations while returning cash to investors via <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/share-repurchase/\">share repurchases</a> and <a href=\"/terms/d/dividend-payments/\">dividend payments</a>. As a result, Rio Tinto is well-positioned to cope with changes in demand for these commodities and create value for its shareholders.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"14qqm\"></p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"2n4eh\"></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2uatg\">Nucor is the largest and most diversified steel and steel products company in North America. It’s also the continent’s largest steel recycler.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2s093\">The company’s focus on steel positions it for two megatrends. First, steel is essential for making wind turbines, so it’s vital to the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/renewable-energy-stocks/\">renewable energy</a> industry. Steel is also crucial for infrastructure, such as bridges and railways, making it a beneficiary of increased infrastructure spending in the U.S.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"fgkrf\">Nucor has a low and highly variable cost structure. Because of that, it has a long history of generating <a href=\"/terms/f/free-cash-flow/\">free cash flow</a> throughout the cycle. The steelmaker has maintained a strong balance sheet and its is now a <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/dividend-kings/\">Dividend King</a> after 50+ years of growing their dividend payments.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"8r1sj\"></p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"5a19c\"></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bjbgf\">Air Products &amp; Chemicals is one of the world’s leading industrial gas companies. It supplies essential industrial gasses to the <a>refining</a>, chemical, metals, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage industries. It’s also a leading global supplier of <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/liquefied-natural-gas-stocks/\">liquefied natural gas</a> (LNG) process technology and equipment.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"f0l5f\">The company is a major supplier of <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/hydrogen-stocks/\">hydrogen</a>, which could play an important role in fueling the economy in the future. In addition, its expertise in carbon capture and storage could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Add that to its importance to the growth of LNG, a widely used fuel, and Air Products is playing a vital role in helping the global economy transition to cleaner energy sources.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ftu0\">Air Products also boasts a strong financial profile, including an excellent balance sheet and healthy cash flow. That gives it the financial flexibility to expand its operations and pay a growing dividend.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"b5gch\"></p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"ab5kl\"></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"e6i6c\">Eagle Materials is a leading U.S. building materials producer. It manufactures heavy materials (cement, concrete, and aggregates) and light materials (gypsum wallboard and recycled paperboard). These materials are crucial to the construction industry.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9i7t7\">Eagle Materials strategically focuses on operating heavy materials manufacturing capacity in the U.S. heartland, limiting the impact of competition from imports. Meanwhile, it concentrates its light materials manufacturing capacity in the southern portion of the country where home construction is rising. These features enable it to benefit from higher prices and make more money on the materials it produces.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"cv4rr\">Eagle Materials produces a lot of cash, giving it the funds to expand its operations and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its expansion focus in recent years has been on the heavy materials side of its business, acquiring several cement manufacturing facilities to boost its capacity. Those deals have helped increase its earnings and shareholder value. Meanwhile, it has sold non-core assets to maintain a strong financial position so that it can take advantage of expansion opportunities when they arise.</p>\n                \n                \n<p>Mining companies find and extract materials and minerals. Can you dig it for your portfolio?</p>\n          \n        \n<p>A closer look at this subgroup of the basic materials sector and some of the best metals stocks to invest in.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>These companies pay their shareholders regularly, making them good sources of income.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>These companies move up and down with economic cycles.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"8ikk4\">While all companies in the basic materials sector face risks related to the health of the economy, the best materials companies are well-positioned financially and benefit from a <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/portfolio-diversification/\">diversified portfolio</a> of operations. The top materials companies have multiple businesses, investment-grade bond ratings, manageable debt, and low production costs. These factors enable them to still make money even when materials prices decline.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"e7f33\">Materials companies are more likely to perform well when the economy is booming, making these companies a better buy in <a href=\"/terms/b/bull-market/\">bull markets</a>. But, even when the economy is growing, fierce competition in the materials sector tends to restrict companies\' abilities to generate substantial profit, which affects share prices.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8rlq3\">Investors need to be very picky when choosing materials stocks. They need to focus their attention on well-run, financially strong companies with visible growth prospects. A sharp focus increases the probability that materials stocks can deliver attractive returns for investors.</p>\n                \n                \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

It produces and supplies the fuels and electricity needed to keep the economy humming.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"ntakv\">The energy industry includes companies involved in the following activities:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"dm66b\">These companies manufacture components to produce electricity using renewable resources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power. They also include companies that operate and develop <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/renewable-energy-stocks/\">renewable energy</a>-generating facilities.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"96a5i\">These companies focus on finding, producing, transporting, storing, refining, and exporting fossil fuels.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9f9vv\">This broad industry is crucial to providing the economy with the energy it needs. It\'s also an important one for investors to understand.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"ch4t5\">Hundreds of public companies focus on the production and distribution of energy. However, a few leaders stand out because of their size and financial strength. Here are five of the best energy stocks to consider buying in 2025:</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"67wau\">Here’s a closer look at some of the best energy stocks in the industry:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"jvyq0\"><b>Brookfield Renewable</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"288040\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/bep/\">BEP</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.59%</span></span>)(<a href=\"/quote/nyse/bepc/\">NYSE:BEPC</a>)is a leading global renewable energy producer. It operates hydroelectric, solar, wind, and energy transition <a href=\"/terms/a/assets/\">assets</a>. The company sells the power produced by these assets under long-term fixed-rate power purchase agreements (PPAs) to electric utilities and other large power users.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1dfn8\">The contracts enable Brookfield to generate relatively steady <a href=\"/terms/c/cash-flow/\">cash flows</a>. It pays out a large portion of that money to investors via an attractive dividend. The company retains the balance to acquire, develop, and expand its renewable energy operations.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"fv20e\">Brookfield Renewable has an enormous backlog of renewable energy development projects. Combined with other growth drivers such as acquisitions and higher power prices, Brookfield expects to increase its <a href=\"/terms/f/ffo/\">funds from operation (FFO)</a> per share by more than 10% annually through 2029. Meanwhile, it has increasingly visible and secured growth through 2034. That should support a 5% to 9% annual dividend growth, making Brookfield an excellent <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/renewable-energy-dividend-stocks/\">renewable energy dividend stock</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"in3x3\"><b>ConocoPhillips</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"203175\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/cop/\">COP</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.19%</span></span>) is a diversified oil and natural gas producer. It has operations around the world and uses several methods to produce oil and natural gas.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"27clj\">The oil company significantly enhanced its position by acquiring Marathon Oil in a $22.5 billion all-stock deal that closed in late 2024. The transaction will add 2 billion barrels of resources to its U.S. onshore portfolio with an average cost of supply below $30 a barrel. The acquisition will be accretive to its earnings, free cash flow, and return of capital, driven in part by the expectation it will capture more than $1 billion of cost and capital synergies within the first year of closing the deal.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"34ve5\">ConocoPhillips anticipates returning a significant portion of its growing free cash flow to investors in the coming years. It plans to ramp its <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/share-repurchase/\">share repurchase</a> rate from $5 billion annually to $7 billion, putting it on track to buy back more than $20 billion in shares in the first three years following the Marathon deal. It also pays a growing quarterly <a href=\"/terms/d/dividend-payments/\">dividend</a>. ConocoPhillips boosted its payment by 34% in late 2024. It aims to deliver dividend growth within the top 25% of companies in the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/sp-500/\"><b>S&amp;P 500</b></a> in the future.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"p76g5\"><a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-chevron-stock/\"><b>Chevron</b></a> (<a href=\"/quote/nyse/chx/\">NYSE:CHX</a>) is a leading global energy company. It boasts a globally integrated oil and gas business that includes exploration and production assets, refining capabilities, and a <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/materials/chemical-stocks/\">chemicals</a> business. The company’s large-scale and integrated operations help it weather the volatility in the energy sector.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7uvec\">Chevron uses the cash flows generated from its legacy oil and gas operations to pay a growing <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/\">dividend</a>, repurchase shares, and invest in the future. Chevron increased its dividend for the 37th straight year in 2024. It also plans to buy back between $10 billion and $20 billion of its stock each year.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"acl7m\">The company expects to grow its cash flow by more than 10% annually through 2027 (assuming oil averages $60 a barrel), fueled by its high-return capital program. It could significantly exceed that level if it\'s successful in closing its acquisition of <b>Hess</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"209510\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/hes/\">HES</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.05%</span></span>). The roughly $60 billion deal would enable Chevron to more than double its free cash flow by 2027 (if oil averages $70 a barrel) while extending its production growth outlook into the 2030s.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"aev04\">Chevron is also investing in the lower-carbon fuels the world will require in the future. It\'s focusing on <a href=\"/terms/c/carbon-capture-and-storage/\">carbon capture and storage</a>, hydrogen, and renewable fuels. The balance makes it an ideal choice for investors seeking a way to invest in the energy transition from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"l9ye6\"><b>NextEra Energy</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"224237\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/nee/\">NEE</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -4.6%</span></span>) is one of the country\'s largest electric utility companies. It\'s also a global leader in producing power from the wind and sun through its energy resources segment, which sells clean energy to other utilities and end users around the country.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"dl4i0\">These businesses generate relatively stable <a href=\"/terms/c/cash-flow/\">cash flow</a>. It sells and distributes power backed by government-regulated rates and fixed-price PPAs with customers. The business model is very resilient because businesses and households need a steady supply of power.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3cncr\">NextEra Energy has one of the best financial profiles in the electric utility sector. It features one of the highest credit ratings in its peer group. NextEra also has a conservative <a href=\"/terms/d/dividend-payout-ratio/\">dividend payout ratio</a> for a utility, allowing it to pay a stable and growing dividend. The company expects to increase its payout at a 10% annual rate through 2026, making it an excellent renewable energy dividend stock. Its strong financial profile also allows it to make significant investments in new renewable energy capacity and related infrastructure.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5r3sh\">These investments help drive the company\'s expectation that it will grow its adjusted earnings per share at or near the top end of its 6% to 8% per share annual target range through 2027. It boasts strong growth prospects beyond that, powered by the accelerating demand for renewable energy for things like <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/automotive-stocks/electric-car-stocks/\">electric vehicles</a> and <a href=\"/terms/d/data-center/\">data centers</a>. These investments should boost its earnings while reducing its emissions, producing a win-win outcome for shareholders and the planet.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"fy1as\"><b>Enbridge</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"207063\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/enb/\">ENB</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.38%</span></span>) is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America. It has four core operating segments:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"b427v\">Enbridge\'s leading energy infrastructure portfolio generates very stable cash flow backed by long-term contracts and government-regulated rate structures. It significantly enhanced the stability of its earnings profile in 2024 by acquiring three natural gas utilities from <b>Dominion</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"203276\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/d/\">D</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.39%</span></span>) in a $14 billion transformational deal that meaningfully increased its gas distribution business. It now gets about half its earnings from liquids pipelines and the other 50% from lower carbon energy (e.g., gas and renewables).</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"29sb\">The company distributes 60% to 70% of its steady cash flow to investors via a very attractive dividend. It retains the rest to help finance its continued expansion.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2bf53\">The company has a multibillion-dollar backlog of commercially secured expansion projects under construction, giving it lots of visibility into future growth. Enbridge expects its cash flow per share to increase by about 3% per year through 2026 and at a roughly 5% annual rate over the medium term.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"d17a6\">Enbridge\'s growing cash flow should allow it to continue increasing its dividend. The company delivered its 30th consecutive annual dividend increase at the end of 2024.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"fkdfq\">The energy sector is a challenging one for investors, especially when it comes to oil and natural gas companies. Energy prices can change in a heartbeat. <a href=\"/terms/s/stock-market-volatility/\">Volatility</a> can have a massive impact on the sector, as well as on the global economy.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3rru5\">Because of the impact commodity price volatility can have on the energy sector, investors need to understand <a>how to invest in energy stocks</a>. That includes keeping risks in mind and not allocating too much of a portfolio to one energy stock or the entire industry. Investors should focus on oil and natural gas companies with the financial and operational strength to survive if industry conditions significantly deteriorate.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8254t\">Factors that increase an energy company\'s durability include:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ljgi\">Energy companies with these characteristics will be in a better position to withstand the inevitable <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/cyclical-stocks/\">cyclical</a> downturns. That means they will still be around when market conditions improve. They will also have more flexibility than their weaker peers to capture opportunities that can create value for their investors.</p>\n                \n                \n<p>Investing in an exchange-traded fund can be a great way to play this sector.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>This article breaks down the nuclear energy industry, opportunities, risks, and what investors need to understand.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Infrastructure is the backbone of the economy, so these companies can help build your portfolio.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>These often slow and steady stocks can create wealth over time.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"8vjvo\">The energy sector is vital to the global economy because it provides the fuel and power needed to drive trade and <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/travel-stocks/travel-etfs/\">travel</a>. However, when the economy slows, as many fear might happen in 2025, it can have a major impact on energy demand and prices. That can put significant weight on energy stock prices.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2mrs2\">The best energy stocks to buy are those that can easily survive a downturn and thrive when market conditions improve. Energy stock investors should also consider putting more attention on cleaner energy companies using renewable sources. The world is steadily transitioning to cleaner fuels to ensure we avoid the worst possible impacts of <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/esg-investing/climate-change-stocks/\">climate change</a>.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"nxghs\">A few leaders stand out because they’re larger in size and have strong financial profiles. Here are a few of the top energy companies to consider:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"nb2n6\">The energy sector is vital to the global economy because it provides the fuel and power needed to drive trade and travel. However, when the economy slows, it can have a major impact on energy demand and prices. That can put significant weight on energy stock prices.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"flo1p\">Conversely, when the economy hits the accelerator, demand soars and usually takes prices up with it. Investors should focus on the stocks of companies that can easily survive a downturn. In addition, they should consider focusing more attention on clean energy companies using renewable sources.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"2vcua\">The best utility investments are companies with a top-notch financial profile and visible growth prospects. Each of the companies below meets those criteria and has the potential to produce above-average <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/stock-total-return/\">total stock returns</a> -- dividend yield plus stock price appreciation.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"hso1d\">Here is a list of standout companies, followed by our assessment of each investment:</p>\n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

A share of stock represents a slice of ownership in a company and entitled the owner to benefit from its future profits.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bnkud\">When done in the right way, investing in stocks is among the most effective ways to <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/how-to-build-wealth/\">build long-term wealth</a>. But like most financial moves, there are right ways and wrong ways to invest in the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/basics/\">stock market</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"47tm6\">With that in mind, here\'s a step-by-step guide to investing money in the stock market to help you ensure you\'re doing it correctly.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"tjyfb\">The first thing to consider is <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/\">how to start investing</a> in stocks the right way <i>for you</i>. Some investors buy individual stocks, while others take a less active approach with <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/etf-vs-mutual-fund/\">mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a> (more on those in a bit). Both can be equally valid ways to put your money to work.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"vkt5s\">Try this. Do one or more of the following statements describe you?</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6aw69\">The good news is that regardless of which of these statements you agree with, you\'re still a great candidate to become a stock market investor. The only thing that will change is how you do it.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"dtgsh\">You should invest in <a href=\"/terms/s/stock/\">individual stocks</a> if -- and only if -- you have the time and desire to thoroughly research and evaluate stocks on an ongoing basis. If this is the case, we 100% encourage you to do so.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"61eih\">On the other hand, if things like <a href=\"/terms/e/earnings-season/\">quarterly earnings</a> reports and <a href=\"/investing/how-to-calculate/\">moderate mathematical calculations</a> don\'t sound appealing, there\'s absolutely nothing wrong with taking a more <a href=\"/terms/p/passive-indexing/\">passive approach</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9k7ql\">If you\'d like to play a role in your investment decisions but don\'t necessarily want to choose individual stocks, you can <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/index-funds/\">invest in index funds</a>, which track a stock index like the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/sp-500/\"><b>S&amp;P 500</b></a>. Index funds typically have significantly <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/index-funds/low-cost-index-funds/\">lower costs</a> and are virtually guaranteed to match the long-term performance of their underlying indexes, minus some small investment fees.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"87n4p\">Does putting your stock investing on autopilot sound like the best choice for you? One option that has exploded in popularity in recent years is the <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/money/buying-stocks/best-robo-advisors/\">robo-advisor</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"b7c91\">A robo-advisor, also known as an automated investing platform, is a brokerage that invests your money on your behalf in a <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/portfolio-investment/\">portfolio</a> of index funds appropriate for your age, risk tolerance, and investing goals. Not only can a robo-advisor select your investments, but many will also optimize your <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/taxes-on-investments/\">tax efficiency</a> and make changes over time automatically.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"ikig5\">First, let\'s talk about the money you <i>shouldn\'t</i> invest in stocks. In simple terms, the stock market is no place for money that you might need within the next five years, at a minimum. Money you need to <a href=\"/retirement/college-savings/\">pay your kids\' tuition</a>, finance a home renovation, or pay day-to-day expenses in retirement should be kept in less volatile investment vehicles.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"epoxu\">While the stock market will almost certainly rise over the long run, there\'s simply too much uncertainty in <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-are-stock-prices-determined/\">stock prices</a> in the short term. In fact, a drawdown of 20% in any given year isn\'t unusual, and occasional drops of 40% or even more do happen. Stock market volatility is <i>normal</i> and should be expected.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"dalda\">So, here\'s what money you shouldn\'t be investing:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5nch0\">Now, let\'s talk about what to do with your investable money -- that is, the money you <i>won\'t</i> likely need within the next five years. How you distribute it is a concept known as <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/what-to-invest-in/asset-allocation/\">asset allocation</a>, and a few factors come into play here. Your age is a major consideration, as are your particular <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/risk-tolerance/\">risk tolerance</a> and <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/how-to-set-investment-goals/\">investment goals</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6glvu\">Let\'s start with your age. The general idea is that as you get older, stocks gradually become a less desirable place to keep your money. If you\'re young, you have decades ahead of you to ride out any ups and downs in the market, but this isn\'t the case if you\'re retired and rely on your portfolio for income.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5tbu4\">Here\'s a quick rule of thumb, known as the <a href=\"/terms/r/rule-of-110/\">Rule of 110</a>, to help you establish a ballpark asset allocation.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"869gp\">To use it, simply subtract your age from 110. This is the approximate percentage of your investable money that should be in stocks (including <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/mutual-funds/mutual-funds-to-invest-in/\">mutual funds</a> and <a href=\"/terms/e/etfs/\">exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a> that are stock-based). The remainder should be in fixed-income investments like <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/bonds/\">bonds</a> or <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/money/banks/cds/best-cd-rates/\">high-yield certificates of deposit (CDs)</a>. You can then adjust this ratio up or down depending on your particular risk tolerance.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"93m2u\">For example, let\'s say you are 40 years old. This rule suggests that 70% of your investable money should be in stocks, with the other 30% in <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/what-to-invest-in/fixed-income-investments/\">fixed-income</a> investments like bonds or high-yield CDs.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"aaj46\">Now, this is just a rule of thumb. You can customize it to your personal situation. If you\'re more of a risk taker or are planning to work past a typical <a href=\"/research/average-retirement-age/\">retirement age</a>, you may want to shift this ratio in favor of stocks. On the other hand, if you don\'t like big fluctuations in your portfolio, you might want to modify it in the other direction.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8mtsh\">All the advice about investing in stocks for beginners doesn\'t do you much good if you don\'t have any way to actually <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-buy-stock/\"><i>buy</i> stocks</a>. To do this, you\'ll need a specialized type of account called a brokerage account.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"c85j\">These accounts are offered by companies such as <b>Charles Schwab</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"206628\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/schw/\">SCHW</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.77%</span></span>), E*TRADE from <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/who-owns-morgan-stanley/\"><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"206252\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/ms/\">MS</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.65%</span></span>), and many others, as well as by newer app-based platforms like <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/money/buying-stocks/robinhood-review/\"><b>Robinhood</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"345207\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/hood/\">HOOD</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 5.91%</span></span>) and <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-sofi-stock/\"><b>SoFi</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"344590\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/sofi/\">SOFI</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 7.86%</span></span>). Opening a brokerage account is typically a quick, painless process that takes only minutes.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"cvrvi\">You can easily fund your brokerage account via an electronic funds transfer, by mailing a check, or by wiring money.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"credq\">Opening a <a href=\"/terms/b/brokerage-account/\">brokerage account</a> is generally easy, but you should consider a few things before choosing a particular broker:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"c3eqb\">First, determine the type of brokerage account you need. For most people who are just trying to learn stock market investing, this means choosing between a standard brokerage account and an <a href=\"/retirement/plans/ira/\">individual retirement account (IRA)</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9kjii\">Both account types will allow you to buy stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs. The main considerations here are <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/why-invest-in-stocks/\">why you\'re investing in stocks</a> and how easily you want to be able to access your money.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"6on4g\">If you want easy access to your money, are just investing for a rainy day, or want to invest more than the annual <a href=\"/retirement/plans/ira/contribution-limits/\">IRA contribution limit</a>, you\'ll probably want a standard brokerage account.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bmqch\">On the other hand, if your goal is to build up a retirement <a href=\"/terms/n/nest-egg/\">nest egg</a>, an IRA is a great way to go. These accounts come in two main varieties -- <a href=\"/retirement/plans/ira/ira-vs-roth-ira/\">traditional and Roth IRAs</a> -- and there are some specialized types of IRAs for self-employed people and small business owners, including the <a href=\"/retirement/plans/sep-ira/\">SEP IRA</a> and <a href=\"/retirement/plans/simple-ira/\">SIMPLE IRA</a>. IRAs are very tax-advantaged places to buy stocks, but the downside is that it can be difficult to withdraw your money until you get older.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"966aa\">One potentially appealing feature of <a href=\"/retirement/plans/roth-ira/roth-ira-vs-brokerage-account/\">Roth IRAs</a> is the ability to withdraw your contributions (but not your investment profits) at any time and for any reason. This can be a big positive feature for people who might not want their money tied up until retirement.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"40b87\">The majority of online stockbrokers have eliminated trading commissions for online stock trades. So, most (but not all) are on a level playing field as far as costs are concerned, unless you\'re trading <a href=\"/terms/o/options/\">options</a> or <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/guide-to-cryptocurrencies/\">cryptocurrencies</a>, both of which often have trading fees.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"d560k\">However, there are several other big differences. For example, some brokers offer customers a variety of educational tools, access to investment research, and other features that are especially useful for newer investors. Others offer the ability to trade on foreign stock exchanges. And some have physical branch networks, which can be nice if you want face-to-face investment guidance.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8gmlt\">There\'s also the user-friendliness and functionality of the broker\'s trading platform to consider. Many will let you try a demo version before committing any money; if that\'s the case, it can be well worth the time.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"tymeb\"><a href=\"https://www.fool.com/money/buying-stocks/best-online-stock-brokers-for-beginners/\">Browse top stock brokerages</a></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ua9m9\">Now that we\'ve answered the question of <i>how</i> you buy stocks, if you\'re looking for some great beginner-friendly investment ideas, here is a list of our <a href=\"/investing/top-stocks-to-buy-and-hold/\">top stocks to buy and hold this year</a> to help get you started. Note that it isn\'t intended as personal advice -- just some well-run businesses to help get your search started.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"x8u57\">Of course, in just a few paragraphs, we can\'t go over everything you should consider when selecting and analyzing stocks, but here are the important concepts to master before you get started:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"35jge\">It\'s a good idea to learn the concept of <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/portfolio-diversification/\">diversification</a>, which means you should have a variety of different types of companies in your portfolio. However, I\'d caution against <a href=\"/terms/o/over-diversification/\">too much diversification</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"716k9\">Stick with businesses you understand -- and if it turns out that you\'re good at (or comfortable with) evaluating a particular type of stock, there\'s nothing wrong with one industry making up a relatively large segment of your portfolio. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has a disproportionate amount of money invested in <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/\">financial sector stocks</a> because he knows the industry very well.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"xt320\">If you want to invest in individual stocks, you should familiarize yourself with some of the basic ways to evaluate them.

He\'s not only the most successful long-term investor of all time but also one of the best sources of wisdom for your <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/investment-strategies/\">investment strategy</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1jes5\">The most surefire way to make money in the stock market is to <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-many-shares-buy-stock/\">buy shares</a> of great businesses at reasonable prices and hold on to the <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/stock-v-share/\">shares</a> for as long as the businesses remain great (or until you need the money). If you do this, you\'ll experience some <a href=\"/terms/s/stock-market-volatility/\">volatility</a> along the way, but over time, you\'ll enjoy excellent investment returns.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"3t3k\">There are literally hundreds of categories and sub-categories of stocks. However, here are some of the common categories investors should be familiar with:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3tvvu\">As mentioned, stocks can be a great way to create wealth over time. Over periods of several decades, major stock market averages have produced returns of between 9% and 10% annually.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6rbue\">The risks have to do with how volatile stocks can be over short periods of time. Swings in the stock market of 10% are rather common, happening about once a year, and 20% or greater declines (which is what defines a bear market) happen occasionally.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"smaf0\">Yes, as long as you choose a reputable and properly registered company, a stock investing app is very safe. Note that I mean it\'s safe in terms of the company being legitimate -- there\'s no guarantee about the safety of the investments you choose. One quick check is to make sure the brokerage app you choose is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC, essentially the equivalent of the FDIC for the brokerage industry).</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"jyaul\">There are a few things you need to do before you start investing. First, determine your risk tolerance, then decide whether you want to invest in individual stocks or more passive investments like ETFs.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"c7ctm\">Next, decide how much money you can invest long term and which brokerage or robo-advisor is best for you. Perhaps most importantly, when you\'re just getting started, take advantage of the educational resources at your disposal and learn all you can.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"sodl7\">The first step in buying stock is to open a brokerage account, which is a specialized financial account designed to buy, hold, and sell investments. There are many different brokers, but beginners should generally choose one that is easy to use and doesn\'t require a minimum initial deposit. However, the best broker for you depends on your particular risk tolerance and investment strategy.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"ocmuk\">You can get started investing with a relatively small amount of money, and thanks to the emergence of fractional share trading, you can build a diverse portfolio with just $100. <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/how-to-invest-100-dollars/\">If you have $100 to invest</a>, here are our best suggestions for what to do with it:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"jyaul\">There\'s no one-size-fits-all answer to this question since we all have different financial situations. But a general rule is that you shouldn\'t invest any of your savings that you\'ll need within the next few years. It\'s not uncommon for the market to decline by 20% or more in any given year. And once you start investing, it\'s a great strategy to regularly add money to your investment account over time.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"8vb33\">Here\'s your step-by-step guide to opening a brokerage account:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"nfhqw\">The S&amp;P 500 (also known as the Standard &amp; Poor\'s 500) is a stock index comprising the 500 largest companies in the U.S. Its performance is generally considered the best indicator of how U.S. stocks are performing overall.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"sodl7\">If you\'re investing in stocks, your returns will not be consistent from month to month, so it\'s impossible to say for sure. If you\'re investing in fixed-income instruments like bonds or CDs, you can divide $12,000 ($1,000 per month, expressed yearly) by your expected <a href=\"/terms/a/annual-percentage-yield/\">annual percentage yield (APY)</a> to figure out how much you need to invest.</p>\n      \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

An index collects data from a variety of companies across industries. Together, that data forms a picture that helps investors compare current price levels with past prices to calculate market performance.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"tlesm\">Some indexes focus on a smaller subset of the market. For example, the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/nasdaq/\">Nasdaq stock index</a> closely tracks the technology sector. So if you want to know how technology companies are performing, you’d want to look at the Nasdaq index.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"nlsmz\">Indexes also vary in size, with some tracking just a handful of stocks and others looking at thousands. Each index serves a unique purpose because different investors are interested in different sectors.</p>\n                \n                \n<p>One of the oldest stock indexes, the Dow Jones tracks 30 of the largest U.S. companies.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>The 500 largest companies make up this bellwether index.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Once you understand how the Nasdaq Composite Index works, you can learn to use this index to help guide you in creating wealth.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>The Russell 2000 index is considered a benchmark for smaller U.S. stocks.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"ahbuk\">Beyond these <a href=\"/markets/\">famous stock market indexes</a>, however, there are thousands of lesser-known indexes. You can find indexes that reflect the performance of stocks in a certain country or that do business in a given <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/\">sector of the economy</a>. Some indexes separate large, mid-sized, and small companies into different categories. Others use investing strategies like growth, value, or dividend investing to select component stocks. Pretty much any type of stock you might be interested in, there\'s an index for that. The rise of index mutual funds and ETFs has led to a proliferation of indexes to help fund managers use <a href=\"/terms/p/passive-income/\">passive investing strategies</a> to minimize costs and let investors tailor their portfolio exposure as precisely as they like.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bi6bg\">Technically, the S&amp;P 500 is a part of a total-market index known as the <b>S&amp;P 1500</b>. The S&amp;P 500 is the large-cap portion, but other segments are:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ds7nz\"><a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/index-funds/\">Learn how to invest in index funds.</a></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"avbrz\">Reading an index correctly requires that you look at how the index value changes over time. New stock market indexes always begin with a certain fixed value based on the stock prices on its starting date. Thereafter, future index values measure rising and falling prices for those component stocks.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ij27p\">Not all stock market indexes use the same starting value, however, so just measuring index changes by using points can be misleading. For instance, if one index rises 250 points in a day while another rises just 10 points, it might seem as though the first index performed far better. However, if the first index started the day at 25,000 while the second index was at 250, then you can see that in percentage terms, the gains for the second index were far greater. A higher percentage gain means a bigger profit for you if you invest in funds that track the index, so it\'s better to focus on percentages than on point movements.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"whda9\">Moreover, even the most popular stock market indexes don\'t generally measure the performance of the entire market. Knowing which stocks are in an index can tell you which parts of the stock market are contributing to that index\'s performance and can explain why other indexes might not be performing the same way.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8gk4n\">Stock market indexes can be useful to follow for a few key reasons:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"s08m8\">Stock market indexes make it easier to know how the market is performing without having to follow the ups and downs of every individual stock. They also open up simple investment opportunities that even novice investors can use to participate in the long-term success of the stock market.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"9ntnc\">Each stock in an index has a weighting assigned to it. Stocks with higher weightings have more influence on the index\'s movements than those with lower weightings. There are three different ways that indexes typically assign weightings to their stocks:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"q25jv\">There are some other stock market indexes that use proprietary methods to come up with weightings. For example, some indexes assign weightings based on the dividends that a stock pays out. For the most part, though, market-cap-weighted indexes are most prevalent, as they\'re often the easiest for <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/index-funds/\">index funds</a> to track.</p>\n                \n                \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

In 2024, <b>Virtuals Protocol</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"560573\"><a href=\"/quote/crypto/virtual/\">VIRTUAL</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -3.83%</span></span>) increased by more than 23,000%, one of several cryptocurrencies to deliver well over 10x returns. Last year, market leader <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-bitcoin/\"><b>Bitcoin</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"343539\"><a href=\"/quote/crypto/btc/\">BTC</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.99%</span></span>) also added $1.2 trillion to its <a href=\"/terms/m/market-cap/\">market cap</a> and surged past $100,000.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"lzhkp\">Of course, prices can fall just as quickly. There\'s also no guarantee that <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/is-crypto-here-to-stay/\">crypto is here to stay</a>. But overall, the market is trending upward, which is exciting news for crypto investors.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2pvku\">It\'s impossible to know which cryptocurrency is next to boom. However, we can pick out some possible candidates capitalizing on current trends, such as <a href=\"/terms/a/artificial-intelligence/\">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, <a href=\"/terms/d/decentralized-application/\">decentralized applications (dApps)</a>, and <a href=\"/terms/d/digital-assets/\">digital asset</a> trading, as well as some of the larger cryptos in position to grow even more this year.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"a58pk\">Here are the cryptocurrencies that could be due for a significant bull run:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"cveqi\"><b>Render Token</b> (<a href=\"/quote/crypto/rndr/\">CRYPTO:RNDR</a>) is a rendering network that allows users to rent out extra <a href=\"/terms/g/gpu/\">graphics processing unit (GPU)</a> power for rendering (using a computer program to create a photorealistic or non-photorealistic image from a 2D or 3D model). Artists and studios can rent rendering capacity through the Render Network and pay for it with the RNDR <a href=\"/terms/c/crypto-tokens/\">crypto token</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"a9kml\">While many crypto projects haven\'t demonstrated any real-world uses yet, Render has been used in high-profile projects. For example, it was used to create the opening titles for the fourth season of <i>Westworld</i>. Artists have also used Render for a digital <b>Coca-Cola</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204186\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/ko/\">KO</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.06%</span></span>) ad at the Las Vegas sphere, for a Star Trek spatial experience available with the Apple Vision Pro, and for multiple short films.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"e4uac\">It\'s a unique service, and demand will likely grow as more media companies need to convert text to images. The growing popularity of AI could also be good for Render, as training AI models requires considerable GPU power.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7js3p\">Render saw significant <a>year-over-year</a> growth in 2024. Network usage more than tripled, and there were more than 40 million rendered frames, a massive jump from about 10 million in 2023.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"f5sli\">Over the years, plenty of supposed \"<a href=\"/terms/e/ethereum/\"><b>Ethereum</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"343717\"><a href=\"/quote/crypto/eth/\">ETH</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.16%</span></span>) killers\" have offered their own programmable <a href=\"/terms/b/blockchain/\">blockchain</a> platforms. None have been as successful as <a href=\"/terms/s/solana/\"><b>Solana</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"343894\"><a href=\"/quote/crypto/sol/\">SOL</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.16%</span></span>), which became famous for its blazing-fast speeds and transaction fees that cost a fraction of a cent.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6enlm\">Like Ethereum (and several other projects), Solana gives developers a platform to build dApps. It\'s used for <a href=\"/terms/d/decentralized-finance/\">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a> services, minting <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/non-fungible-tokens/\">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</a>, and more. According to a 2024 CoinGecko study, it\'s also the fastest large blockchain. With 1,504 average daily transactions (its maximum theoretical speed is 65,000 transactions per second), it\'s 46 times faster than Ethereum.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"anpbc\">After losing most of its value in 2022 and 2023, Solana\'s price shot up in 2024. Even though it has already delivered impressive returns, it could still have more room to grow.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"ds3rn\"></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"fonq0\"><b>Superintelligence Alliance</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"573375\"><a href=\"/quote/crypto/asi/\">ASI</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -1.2%</span></span>) is a merger of three popular AI cryptos: SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol. All three projects were interesting players in the AI space, and two (SingularityNET and Fetch.ai) have been on this list before.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"fr4j5\">The goal of Superintelligence Alliance is build an open-source blockchain platform for <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/ai-in-business/\">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) research and development. Participants can lend computing power to support AI model training in exchange for crypto tokens.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"m0nr\">The <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/\">AI boom</a> has been one of cryptocurrency\'s most exciting recent technological developments. Superintelligence Alliance is well positioned to capitalize on the trend, especially as the number of <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/companies-that-use-ai/\">companies using AI</a> continues to grow. It plans to leverage:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"95ese\"><b>Bitcoin</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"343539\"><a href=\"/quote/crypto/btc/\">BTC</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.99%</span></span>) is already a top cryptocurrency -- the <i>top</i> cryptocurrency, to be exact. Although it\'s certainly not a dark horse crypto that will triple in value, it had some very positive news in 2024.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2eiic\">After years of waiting, the <a href=\"/terms/s/sec/\">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> finally approved <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/bitcoin-etfs/\">Bitcoin ETFs</a> in January 2024. There are now more than 10 Bitcoin ETFs available, which makes investing in the market\'s largest cryptocurrency easier than ever and has led to more <a href=\"/terms/i/institutional-investor/\">institutional investors</a> buying Bitcoin.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6ivck\">Although all cryptos are volatile, Bitcoin\'s size makes it safer since it\'s more likely to stick around. While smaller coins often deliver bigger returns, Bitcoin is far more reliable -- when the crypto market is doing well, the same is usually also true for Bitcoin. If you\'re looking for a comparatively low-risk crypto investment that could do well in 2025 and beyond, Bitcoin is worth considering.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"81ea\"><b>Thorchain</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"399472\"><a href=\"/quote/crypto/rune/\">RUNE</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -1.1%</span></span>) is a decentralized crypto exchange that operates through an automated market maker (AMM) model. It has liquidity pools for cryptocurrencies managed by smart contracts. Anyone can use Thorchain by connecting their <a href=\"/terms/b/blockchain-wallet/\">blockchain wallet</a> to trade more than 5,500 cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7v2c0\">Centralized crypto exchanges have had their share of high-profile issues, including the collapse of FTX in 2022. It\'s understandable why many investors would want full control of their crypto and use decentralized exchanges when possible.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"a4hv3\">While many decentralized exchanges are available, Thorchain stands out for its experience in the space and its recent growth. It was founded in 2018, but the business started picking up toward the end of 2023, when it had about $1 billion per week in swap volume.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"fckuo\"></p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"7p9p5\"></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"e79qt\"><b>Aave</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"344000\"><a href=\"/quote/crypto/aave/\">AAVE</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.54%</span></span>) is a DeFi protocol and lending platform that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrency. Everything is done with smart contracts, so no intermediary is required. Users can earn interest on the digital assets they lend.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"dba9m\">Aave has liquidity pools for many popular cryptocurrencies, such as <a href=\"/terms/t/tether/\"><b>Tether</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"343845\"><a href=\"/quote/crypto/usdt/\">USDT</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.01%</span></span>) and <b>DAI</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"343689\"><a href=\"/quote/crypto/dai/\">DAI</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.02%</span></span>). One reason Aave could be a long-term winner is that in addition to <a href=\"/terms/c/crypto-lending/\">crypto lending</a>, it has expanded into real-world assets by partnering with Centrifuge.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"hofp\">As part of that partnership, Aave has built a real-world asset (RWA) market that allows companies to tokenize parts of their businesses. Investors can buy tokens offered by those businesses, and the issuers of the tokens can then <a href=\"/terms/s/stablecoins/\">borrow stablecoins</a> against their assets.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2i7gr\"><a href=\"/terms/e/ethereum/\"><b>Ethereum</b></a> has been the second-largest cryptocurrency for years. It\'s notable for being the first blockchain to offer smart contracts, which developers can use to build dApps.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8ii9l\">There has been some positive news for Ethereum in recent years. It went through its long-awaited change to a <a href=\"/terms/p/proof-of-stake/\">proof-of-stake system</a> in September 2022, significantly improving its energy efficiency. After making that switch, its energy consumption dropped by more than 99.9%. In July 2024, the SEC approved <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/ethereum-etfs/\">Ethereum ETFs</a>.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"bt1tm\">That hasn\'t translated into sizable returns so far, especially compared to what market leader Bitcoin has been doing. Ethereum\'s performance hasn\'t impressed investors, and some institutional investors have decided to sell.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"dbjha\">However, Ethereum is still widely used and one of the most popular cryptocurrencies. This down period could be a good buying opportunity for one of the few cryptocurrencies, other than Bitcoin, to demonstrate long-term success and staying power.</p>\n<p>This form of ledger technology is what\'s behind cryptocurrencies and other tech trends.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>This guide will explain everything you need to know about taxes on crypto trading and income.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Investing in virtual currency has produced jaw-dropping returns for some, but the field still presents risks.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Ever wonder why some crypto is more valuable than others? We break down some of the factors.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"sqqm\">It\'s tempting to try to find that next big cryptocurrency. Even though you could potentially see incredible returns this way, it\'s also difficult, time-consuming, and extremely risky.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"p4nq\">For starters, you\'ll need to look for cryptocurrencies outside the market leaders. Smaller cryptocurrencies have greater growth potential but are also more likely to fold, so there\'s a bigger chance of losing your entire investment. You might want to put some of your money into <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/\">cryptocurrency stocks</a> or large-cap coins to balance that out.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9ufej\">Researching those smaller cryptocurrencies takes time. And even if a project looks like a sure-fire winner, anything could happen in the crypto market. Your carefully researched investment could go nowhere, while a practically useless cryptocurrency goes to the moon just because it has <a><b>Shiba Inu</b></a> (<a href=\"/quote/crypto/shib/\">CRYPTO:SHIB</a>) or <a><b>Dogecoin</b></a> (<a href=\"/quote/crypto/doge/\">CRYPTO:DOGE</a>) in its name.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"94ijm\">Following cryptocurrency trends or trying to predict them is not a good investment strategy. There\'s nothing wrong with giving it a shot, but keep your expectations -- and the amount you invest -- very low.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"yyrey\">Cryptos that could boom in 2025 include Render Token (a rendering network) and Solana.

That\'s certainly true. Stocks have performed virtually any other major asset class over long periods.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"jku1\">But do you know how the stock market works? Do you know <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-buy-stock/\">how to buy and sell stocks</a>? Do you <i>truly</i> know what a stock is?</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7tl04\">If you answered no to any of these, you aren\'t alone. The stock market can seem very complex and confusing. And unfortunately, most schools don\'t spend nearly enough time (or any at all) teaching how it works.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2h7uv\">Fortunately, the basics of the stock market are less complicated than you might think. With that in mind, here\'s a rundown of the basics of stock markets, stock exchanges, and stock indexes.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"fvch4\">Before we get into stock markets, you need to understand stocks and how they work on a basic level. Here are a few <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/basics/\">basic concepts</a> that can help new investors understand how the stock market works.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9rlja\">Stocks represent an ownership interest in businesses that choose to have their shares available to public investors. These are known as publicly traded companies. You may also hear stocks referred to as equities or equity securities.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"dloea\">A <a href=\"/terms/s/stock-share/\">share of stock</a> represents an ownership interest in a company. If you buy a share of <b>Apple</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"202686\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/aapl/\">AAPL</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.53%</span></span>), you own a small part of the business and get to share in the company\'s success.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6jl9l\">Instead of being owned by an individual or a private group, some companies (such as Apple) choose to \"go public\" with an <a href=\"/terms/i/ipo/\">initial public offering (IPO)</a>. This means that anyone can become a part owner by purchasing shares of the company\'s stock. There are thousands of public companies you can choose to buy stock in.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5kg7t\">How does the stock market work? There are entire books explaining the stock market, and there\'s too much to explain in a few paragraphs.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"95gkn\">The good news is you don\'t need to get too deep to gain a good basic understanding of the stock market. Stock markets facilitate the sale and purchase of stocks between individual investors, <a href=\"/terms/i/institutional-investor/\">institutional investors</a>, and companies.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"251tg\">The vast majority of stock trades take place among investors. If you want to buy shares of <b>Microsoft</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204577\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/msft/\">MSFT</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.22%</span></span>), you can hit the \"buy\" button through your broker\'s website. When you do, you are buying shares that another investor has decided to sell -- not from Microsoft itself. By purchasing shares of a stock, you <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/\">become an investor</a> in the company.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"ev28n\"><a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-are-stock-prices-determined/\">Stock prices</a> on exchanges are governed by supply and demand, plain and simple.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"59n2t\">At any given time, there\'s a maximum price someone is willing to pay for a certain stock, known as the <a href=\"/terms/b/bid-ask/\">bid price</a>. There\'s also a minimum price someone else is willing to set for the shares of stock, known as the ask price.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2u265\">Think of stock market trading like an auction. Buyers are constantly bidding for the stocks that other investors are willing to sell.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9a5e5\">If there is a lot of demand for a stock, investors will buy shares quicker than sellers want to get rid of them. This can move the price higher. On the other hand, if more investors are selling a stock than buying, the market price will drop.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"4rlj6\">There are plenty of catalysts that can push the market up or down. For example, in the recent stock market downturn, big reasons for the market\'s poor performance included <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/inflation/\">inflation</a> pressures, <a href=\"/terms/s/supply-chain/\">supply chain</a> issues, rising <a href=\"/terms/i/interest-rates/\">interest rates</a>, and <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/basics/crashes/how-long-do-recessions-last/\">recession</a> fears. These factors resulted in more investors selling stock than buying, which is why we saw stock prices generally decline.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5pn1v\">Taking it a step further, it\'s important to consider how it\'s almost always possible to buy or sell a stock you own. That\'s where market makers come in.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"cgmen\">A key concept when it comes to understanding the stock market is the idea of a <a href=\"/terms/m/market-maker/\">market maker</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"71v28\">Think of it this way. There aren\'t <i>always</i> buyers to match up with sellers of stocks. However, stock trades typically go through in seconds. How can brokers buy and sell stocks in your account instantaneously?</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2gf50\">Individuals known as market makers act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. This ensures there\'s always a <a href=\"/terms/l/liquidity/\">liquid marketplace</a> for stocks on an exchange. With a liquid market like this, investors can choose to buy and sell shares <i>immediately</i>, whenever they want, during market hours. Here\'s a rundown of what investors should know about the process:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"b7tkl\">Because of market makers, you\'ll never have to wait to <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/when-to-sell-stocks/\">sell stocks</a> at their full market value. You don\'t need to wait until a buyer wants your exact number of shares. If you choose to sell, a market maker will buy your shares right away.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"bk6mt\">Investors must carry out the transactions of buying or selling stocks through a broker. In a nutshell, a broker is simply an entity licensed to trade stocks on a <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/exchange/\">stock exchange</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2h892\">Throughout most of the stock market\'s history, a broker has been an actual person whom you tell what to buy and sell. In the modern era, however, it is an <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/money/buying-stocks/\">online stock broker</a> -- say, Schwab or Fidelity. Firms like these usually process the entire transaction electronically, although most still offer the ability to complete a trade by phone.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7tda9\">When you buy a stock, here\'s the simplified version of how it works:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"4pq8d\">When discussing the stock market, people often generalize \"the market\" to a stock index. Stock indexes, such as the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/sp-500/\"><b>S&amp;P 500</b></a> or the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/dow-jones/\"><b>Dow Jones Industrial Average</b></a>, are a representation of the performance of a large group of stocks or a <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/\">particular stock market sector</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"4rkfo\">These are used as a benchmark to compare the performance of individual stocks or an entire portfolio. For example, the S&amp;P 500 index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"96fni\">Indexes are a convenient way to discuss an approximation of what is happening in the market. However, it\'s important to understand that the major stock indexes you see on TV and in the news do not fully represent the entire stock market. It\'s entirely possible for a stock to decline even if a certain index is up, and vice versa.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"l0z1c\">When someone says \"the market is up\" or that a stock \"beat the market,\" they are usually referring to a <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/\">stock index</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3uj9g\">There are three different terms here with similar and often misunderstood meanings:</p>\n<p>Stocks come in all different sizes and varieties. We break it down.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Learn about why earnings reports matter and what upcoming earnings reports investors should watch for.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Stock charts can be useful for analyzing long-term investments. Here\'s how to read them.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>What are the major indexes, and what stocks do they contain?</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"8mobi\">Knowing the basics of how stock markets work can help make you a better investor.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1mdli\">You\'ll understand why your investments can be bought and sold at a moment\'s notice. You\'ll also understand that the market works like an auction system. And you\'ll understand that prices are governed by supply and demand and not just the underlying business fundamentals.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"gdzhu\"><a href=\"https://www.fool.com/author/2280/\">Matthew Frankel, CFP®</a> has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

As you dive into researching stocks, you\'ll often hear them discussed with reference to different categories of stocks and different classifications. Here are the major types of stocks you should know.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"0u8i7\">Most <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/\">stock that people invest in</a> is common stock. <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/common-stocks/\">Common stock</a> represents partial ownership in a company, with shareholders getting the right to receive a proportional share of the value of any remaining assets if the company gets dissolved. Common stock gives shareholders theoretically unlimited upside potential, but they also risk losing everything if the company fails without having any assets left over.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7ww1w\"><a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/preferred-stocks/\">Preferred stock</a> works differently by giving shareholders a preference over common shareholders to get back a certain amount of money if the company dissolves. Preferred shareholders also have the right to receive dividend payments before common shareholders. The net result is that preferred stock as an investment often more closely resembles fixed-income bond investments than regular common stock. Often, a company will offer <i>only</i> common stock. This makes sense, since it\'s most often what shareholders want to buy.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5kp9g\"></p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"8ampl\"></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"pc8zc\">Stocks also get categorized by the total worth of all their shares, which is called <a href=\"/terms/m/market-cap/\">market capitalization</a>. Companies with the biggest market capitalizations are called large-cap stocks, with mid-cap and small-cap stocks representing successively smaller companies.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"178t9\">There\'s no precise line that separates these categories from each other. However, one often-used rule is that stocks with market capitalizations of $10 billion or more are treated as <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/large-cap-stocks/\">large-caps</a>, with stocks having market caps between $2 billion and $10 billion qualifying as <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/mid-cap-stocks/\">mid-caps</a>, and stocks with market caps less than $2 billion treated as <a>small-cap stocks</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"gic5l\">Large-cap stocks are generally considered safer and more conservative as investments, while mid-caps and small-caps have a greater capacity for future growth but are riskier. However, just because two companies fall into the same category here doesn\'t mean they have anything else in common as investments or that they\'ll perform in similar ways in the future.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"b8rtl\">You can categorize stocks by where they\'re located. For purposes of distinguishing domestic U.S. stocks from <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/international-stocks/\">international stocks</a>, most investors look at the location of the company\'s official headquarters.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"b77sy\">However, it\'s important to understand that a stock\'s geographical category doesn\'t necessarily correspond to where the company gets its sales. <b>Philip Morris International</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"210565\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/pm/\">PM</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.22%</span></span>) is a great example. Its headquarters are in the U.S., but it sells its tobacco and other products exclusively outside the country. Especially among large multinational corporations, it can be hard to tell from business operations and financial metrics whether a company is truly domestic or international.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"nj4rq\">Another categorization method distinguishes between two popular investment methods. Growth investors tend to look for companies that are seeing their sales and profits rise quickly. Value investors look for companies whose shares are inexpensive, whether relative to their peers or to their own past stock price.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"btke6\"><a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/growth-stocks/\">Growth stocks</a> tend to have higher risk levels, but the potential returns can be extremely attractive. Successful growth stocks have businesses that tap into strong and rising demand among customers, especially in connection with longer-term trends throughout society that support the use of their products and services. Competition can be fierce, though, and if rivals disrupt a growth stock\'s business, it can fall from favor quickly. Sometimes, even just a growth slowdown is enough to send prices sharply lower, as investors fear that long-term growth potential is waning.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"y7z5p\"><a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/value-stocks/\">Value stocks</a>, on the other hand, are seen as being more conservative investments. They\'re often mature, well-known companies that have already grown into industry leaders and don\'t have as much room left to expand further. Yet, with reliable business models that have stood the test of time, they can be good choices for those seeking more price stability while still getting some of the positives of exposure to stocks.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ksj8c\"><a href=\"/stocks/ipo-stocks/\">IPO stocks</a> are stocks of companies that have recently gone public through an initial public offering (IPO). They often generate a lot of excitement among investors looking to get in on the ground floor of a promising business concept. But they can also be volatile, especially when there\'s disagreement within the investment community about their prospects for growth and profit. A stock generally retains its status as an IPO stock for at least a year and for as long as two to four years after it becomes public.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"pmahz\">Many stocks make dividend payments to their shareholders on a regular basis. Dividends provide valuable income for investors, and that makes dividend stocks highly sought after among certain investment circles. Technically, paying even $0.01 per share qualifies a company as a <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/how-to-invest-in-dividend-stocks/\">dividend stock</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7zn7x\">However, stocks don\'t <i>have</i> to pay dividends. Non-dividend stocks can still be strong investments if their prices rise over time. Some of the biggest companies in the world don\'t pay dividends, although the trend in recent years has been toward more stocks making dividend payouts to their shareholders.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"wyr12\">Income stocks are another name for dividend stocks, as the income that most stocks pay out comes in the form of dividends. However, <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/income-stocks/\">income stocks</a> also refer to shares of companies that have more mature business models and have relatively fewer long-term opportunities for growth. Ideal for conservative investors who need to draw cash from their investment portfolios right now, income stocks are a favorite among those in or nearing retirement.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"jg8ff\">National economies tend to follow cycles of expansion and contraction, with periods of prosperity and recession. Certain businesses have greater exposure to broad business cycles, and investors therefore refer to them as cyclical stocks.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"h0vw4\"><a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/cyclical-stocks/\">Cyclical stocks</a> include shares of companies in industries like manufacturing, travel, and luxury goods, because an economic downturn can take away customers\' ability to make major purchases quickly. When economies are strong, however, a rush of demand can make these companies rebound sharply.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6vf8s\">By contrast, non-cyclical stocks, also known as secular or defensive stocks, don\'t have those big swings in demand. An example of non-cyclical stocks would be grocery store chains because no matter how good or bad the economy is, people still have to eat. Non-cyclical stocks tend to perform better during market downturns, while cyclical stocks often outperform during strong <a href=\"/terms/b/bull-market/\">bull markets</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"knr44\">Safe stocks are stocks whose share prices make relatively small movements up and down compared with the overall stock market. Also known as low-volatility stocks, <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/safe-stocks/\">safe stocks</a> typically operate in industries that aren\'t as sensitive to changing economic conditions. They often pay dividends as well, and that income can offset falling share prices during tough times.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"wofvl\">You\'ll often see stocks broken down by the type of business they\'re in. The basic categories most often used include <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/\">stock market sectors</a>:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"p61iy\"><a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/esg-investing/\">ESG investing</a> refers to an investment philosophy that puts emphasis on environmental, social, and governance concerns. Rather than focusing entirely on whether a company generates profit and is growing its revenue over time, ESG principles consider other collateral impacts on the environment, company employees, customers, and shareholder rights.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"yu30l\">Tied to ESG\'s governing rules is socially responsible investing, or SRI. Investors using SRI screen out stocks of companies that don\'t match up to their most important values. However, ESG investing has a more positive element; rather than just excluding companies that fail key tests, it actively encourages investment in specific companies. With evidence showing that a clear commitment to ESG principles can improve investing returns, there\'s a lot of interest in the area.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"njkzn\">Finally, there are stock categories that make judgments based on perceived quality. <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/blue-chip-stocks/\">Blue chip stocks</a> tend to be the cream of the crop in the business world, featuring companies that lead their respective industries and have gained strong reputations. They typically don\'t provide the absolute highest returns, but their stability makes them favorites among investors with a lower tolerance for risk.</p>\n                \n                \n<p>What are the major indexes, and what stocks do they contain?</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Learn about why earnings reports matter and what upcoming earnings reports investors should watch for.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>The markets where people buy and sell stock come in several different flavors.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>There are more than 10,000 publicly traded companies on U.S. stock exchanges. Here are the largest ones.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"5vaib\">Penny stocks are low-quality companies whose stock prices are extremely inexpensive, typically less than $1 per share. With dangerously speculative business models, penny stocks are prone to schemes that can drain your entire investment. It\'s important to know about the<a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/penny-stocks/\"> dangers of penny stocks</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"febl9\">You\'ve probably heard that <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/portfolio-diversification/\">portfolio diversification</a> is important for developing strong, stable investments. Keep all of these stock classifications in mind as you plan for diversity -- investing across companies of different market capitalizations, geographies, and investing styles contributes to a well-balanced portfolio.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"unfei\">Businesses looking to raise money by selling stock may offer one of two different kinds: common stock or preferred stock. Both can be worthwhile investments, and you can find both types of stock on major exchanges. The main difference between preferred and common stock is that preferred stock acts more like a bond with a set dividend and redemption price, while common stock dividends are less guaranteed and carry more risk of loss if a company fails -- but there\'s far more potential for stock price appreciation. </p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"eohdz\">Value investing and growth investing are two different investing styles. Usually, value stocks present an opportunity to buy shares below their actual value, and growth stocks exhibit above-average revenue and earnings growth potential.</p>\n      \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

You can then use it for retirement, to send your kids to college, or for any other financial goals.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"khr5g\">While it\'s common knowledge that investing is a good move, there\'s also the question of <i>what</i> you should invest in. With that in mind, we\'re going to take a closer look at some of the most popular investment vehicles.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"17bps\">We aren\'t going to discuss <i>specific</i> investment ideas here. If that\'s what you\'re looking for, we have tons of great content, such as our list of some of the <a href=\"/investing/top-stocks-to-buy-and-hold/\">top stocks to buy right now</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bhvgc\">Having said that, this is still a very important discussion for new investors. Our objective in this article is to discuss the pros and cons of the different types of investments you can choose, and where they might fit into <i>your</i> ideal investment strategy.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"a9bs\">Finally, we\'ll look at some things you probably shouldn\'t invest in. This can be just as (maybe even more) important than finding great investments.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"4g5hi\">One of the biggest reasons is that many people don\'t know what they can invest in or how to get started. So, here are some of the most common <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/\">ways to invest money</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"66qrl\">Almost everyone should own <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/common-stocks/\">stocks</a> or stock-based investments like <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/etf-vs-mutual-fund/\">exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds</a> (more on those in a bit). If you have a 401(k) or similar retirement plan at work, you probably already have money in the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/basics/\">stock market</a>. There\'s a good reason for this. Stocks have consistently proven to be the best way for the average person to build wealth over the long term.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"e0g06\">U.S. stocks have delivered better returns than bonds, savings accounts, <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/materials/metal-stocks/precious-metal-stocks/\">precious metals</a>, and most other investment types over long periods. Stocks have outperformed most investment classes over almost every 10-year period in the past century. The <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/sp-500/\"><b>S&amp;P 500</b></a> benchmark index has averaged annual returns of 9% to 10% historically, depending on the exact time interval you\'re viewing.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"f5lmb\">To put returns like this into perspective, a $10,000 investment compounded at 10% for 30 years would grow to almost $175,000.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1cpsb\">There are thousands of publicly traded companies you can invest in. You\'re probably quite familiar with many of them. As the companies you invest in grow bigger and more profitable, you own part of a more valuable business.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"f9b1t\">As legendary investor <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/famous-investors/warren-buffett-investments/\">Warren Buffett</a> puts it, investing in U.S. stocks is a bet on American business, and this has been an excellent bet for more than two centuries.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"5q7fs\">If you\'re worried about researching and selecting individual stocks, an alternative is to invest (either exclusively or partially) in <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/etfs-to-buy/\">ETFs</a> and/or <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/mutual-funds/\">mutual funds</a>. For example, if you invest in an <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/index-funds/best-sp-500-index-funds/\">S&amp;P 500 index fund</a>, your money will be spread out among the 500 companies that make up the index.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7ttkf\">Mutual funds are similar to ETFs. They pool investors\' money and use it to accumulate a portfolio of stocks or other investments. The biggest difference is that ETFs trade on major <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/exchange/\">stock exchanges</a>, and you can buy shares whenever the stock market is open. Mutual funds price their shares only once a day and aren\'t nearly as liquid.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"42emo\">Over the long term, growing wealth is the most important step. But once you\'ve built that wealth and gotten closer to retirement age, <a href=\"/terms/b/bonds/\">bonds</a> -- which are loans to a company or government -- can help you <i>stay</i> wealthy. There are three main kinds of bonds:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2bhf9\">For most investors, the best way to go is to buy ETFs and mutual funds that <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/bonds/bonds-vs-stocks/\">invest in bonds</a> on your behalf.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8p0u5\">The main goals of investing in bonds, as opposed to stocks, are capital preservation (preventing yourself from losing money) and income generation.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"d6c33\"><a href=\"/terms/s/savings-account/\">Savings accounts</a> offered by branch-based banks are notorious for paying minuscule interest rates. However, some excellent banks, primarily based online, offer very competitive rates -- to the point that they can be considered investment-worthy in many cases. In May 2025, savings account interest rates in the 3%-4% range were still readily available if you did a little research.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"a5s31\">Many reputable banks offer excellent high-yield <a href=\"/terms/c/certificate-of-deposit/\">certificates of deposit (CDs)</a>. These pay guaranteed yields for anywhere from a few months to five years or more.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5h5d1\">Unlike savings accounts, CDs allow you to lock in a specific yield for a set period. This can be an especially valuable feature when interest rates are relatively high, and you want predictable returns.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"f62k8\">The <a href=\"/terms/f/fdic/\">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)</a> insures CDs and savings accounts up to $250,000 per person per bank to protect you against bank failure.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2ea1n\">Like owning great companies, owning real estate can be a wonderful way to build wealth. In most <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/what-to-invest-in/recession-proof-stocks/\">recessionary periods</a> throughout history, <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/real-estate-investing/commercial-real-estate/stocks/\">commercial real estate</a> has been countercyclical to recessions. It\'s often viewed as a safer, more stable investment than stocks.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5qf11\">There are ways for people at almost every financial level to invest in and make money from real estate. The most obvious is to buy a <a href=\"/terms/r/rental-properties/\">rental property</a>, which can be a great way to build wealth and create an income stream, but it isn\'t the best fit for everyone.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7u3vc\">Fortunately, there are alternative ways to invest in real estate. Many, such as <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/real-estate-investing/reit/\">real estate investment trusts (REITs)</a>, are much more passive than actually becoming a landlord.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"egpr5\">Publicly traded REITs are the most accessible way to invest in real estate. REITs trade on stock market exchanges just like other public companies. REITs can be especially great for income since they don\'t pay corporate taxes as long as they pay out at least 90% of taxable income as dividends to shareholders.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"a5df7\"><a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/\">Cryptocurrencies</a> are a relatively new form of investment vehicle. Popular examples include <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-bitcoin/\"><b>Bitcoin</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"343539\"><a href=\"/quote/crypto/btc/\">BTC</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.94%</span></span>) and <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/ethereum-stock/\"><b>Ethereum</b></a> (<a href=\"/quote/crypto/eth/\">CRYPTO:ETH</a>). If you have knowledge about cryptocurrencies, you can incorporate them into a <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/portfolio-diversification/\">diversified investment portfolio</a>.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"38gci\">No investment approach works for everyone. So, to figure out the best way for <i>you</i> to invest your hard-earned money, here are some things to think about:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"31sj1\">Stocks are not risk-free investments by any definition. Even the most stable companies\' stocks can fluctuate dramatically over short periods of time. Over the past 50 years, the S&amp;P 500 has declined by as much as 37% in a single year and has risen by as much as 38%.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8ndh6\">On the other hand, bonds and other <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/what-to-invest-in/fixed-income-investments/\">fixed-income investments</a> don\'t have as much long-term return potential as stocks. But they make up for it with steady income generation and a lack of volatility.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"8vg5e\">If you have a kid heading off to college in a year or two, or if you\'re retiring in a few years, your goal should no longer be maximizing growth. It should be protecting your <a href=\"/terms/c/capital/\">capital</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5tvd2\">It\'s a good idea to shift the money you\'ll need in the next several years out of stocks and into bonds and cash. This concept is known as <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/what-to-invest-in/asset-allocation/\">asset allocation</a>, and finding the appropriate mix is an important part of investing.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5f78s\">If you have $500 to invest, you can certainly still get started. However, your approach will likely be significantly different and your options somewhat limited compared to those of an investor with $100,000 to get started.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bbu9a\">For example, if you want to buy a rental property, you\'ll need enough money to make a down payment. If you want to put money in a high-yield CD, some of the best choices have minimum investment requirements.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"c7lb1\">Investing in individual stocks can be a great way to <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/how-to-build-wealth/\">build wealth</a> -- <i>if</i> you have the time and knowledge to do it right. If you don\'t, there\'s absolutely nothing wrong with investing in ETFs or mutual funds to get exposure to the stock market.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"cors4\">Just as owning the right investments will help you reach your financial goals, <i>where</i> you invest can be just as important. Many people, especially newer investors, don\'t consider the <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/selling-stock-taxes/\">tax consequences</a> of their investments, which can leave them short of their financial goals.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1c6gp\">Simply put, a little tax planning can go a long way. Here are some examples of different kinds of accounts you may want to use on your investing journey:</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"r4zdr\">The biggest takeaway here is that you should choose the appropriate kind of account based on <i>why</i> you\'re investing. For instance:</p>\n<p>Are you ready to jump into the stock market? We\'ve got you. Build long-term wealth using The Motley Fool\'s market-beating method.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Index funds track a particular index and can be a good way to invest. Get a fast introduction to index funds here.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Bonds are often considered a \"safe\" investment, but are they right for you?</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Here\'s how dividends affect stock prices, and why you should pay close attention to these important dates.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"ajdfe\">To be perfectly clear, every investor is different, and no one pathway works for everyone. However, the best answer for most people is a portfolio that combines stocks (or stock-based ETFs and mutual funds) and fixed-income investments like bonds and CDs.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"cm8u3\">One popular asset allocation guideline financial planners use, known as the <a href=\"/terms/r/rule-of-110/\">Rule of 110</a>, is to subtract your age from 110 to determine the approximate percentage of your portfolio that should be in stocks. For example, according to this rule, a 40-year-old should have roughly 70% of their money invested in stocks and stock-based funds.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"ib8kt\">There are several different types of investments that will help you get started. You can open a standard brokerage account to invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs. Or you can open a retirement account, like an individual retirement account (IRA), to invest in those same options, which could give you some big tax advantages.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"82u4h\">If you prefer a hands-off approach, you can open an account with a <a href=\"/terms/r/robo-advisor/\">robo-advisor</a> that automatically creates an appropriate portfolio for you. Or you could choose alternative investments, such as real estate.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"qkopg\">You have some good choices if you\'re starting with $500 or a similar amount. You could use a robo-advisor to start an automated investment account and add to it periodically. With more brokers offering <a href=\"/terms/f/what-are-fractional-shares/\">fractional share investing</a>, you can even create a diverse portfolio of individual stocks with a $500 initial investment.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"qkopg\">This depends on your particular goals, <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/risk-tolerance/\">risk tolerance</a>, and available capital. For example, there\'s a solid argument to be made that buying simple S&amp;P 500 index funds is the best investment for most people. Yet there\'s also an argument to be made in favor of individual stocks for investors with the time and desire to research their investment choices.</p>\n      \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

Any company that sells a product or service heavily infused with technology likely belongs to the tech sector.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"linh9\"><i>These design and build devices such as:</i></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"auga1\"><i>These design the software that runs on hardware, such as:</i></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"uizev\">Software companies are increasingly moving to a <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/saas-stocks/\">software-as-a-service (SaaS) model</a> in which customers buy a subscription to a program instead of a one-time license. The arrangement generates recurring revenue for the software company.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"yc7ce\">Semiconductor chips largely power the hardware. Semiconductor companies design and/or manufacture central processing units, <a href=\"/terms/g/gpu/\">graphics processing units</a> (GPUs), memory chips, and a wide variety of other chips that help to run today\'s devices.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"j0zpw\"><a>Telecom companies</a> that provide wireless services support the tech sector, but actually belong to the communications sector; so do the video streaming companies that provide easy access to high-quality content, and the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/cloud-stocks/\">cloud computing providers</a> that power those streaming services.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"ivwie\">Many of the most valuable companies in the world are technology companies.

Through the first two months of the year, the S&amp;P 500 and <b>Nasdaq-100</b> dipped 1.4% and 0.5%, respectively.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2msdn\">Several macroeconomic factors have contributed to this underperformance. Inflation appears to be cooling, but consumer spending waned at the start of 2025, a sign that many interpret as a harbinger of a market downturn.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"54bal\">During times like these, <a href=\"/terms/g/growth-stock/\">growth stocks</a>, including technology companies, become less appealing to investors, who instead turn to more conservative options such as stocks in the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/utilities/\">utilities</a> and <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-staples/\">consumer staples</a> sectors.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"68s3e\">Despite the recent underperformance of the tech sector, the market remains keenly focused on tech stocks that have a focus on <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/\">artificial intelligence</a> (AI). Multiple companies have committed to accelerating their AI spend or are in the process of commercializing more AI products. Here are a few highlights:</p>\n<p>We explore the potential for seven top robotics-related stocks.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>This beginner\'s look at AI investing reviews the ins and outs of AI to help you decide whether investing in AI is right for you.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>An in-depth look at up-and-coming company stocks in the U.S. stock market this year. Here\'s what you need to know.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>You invest to get a return. So what makes a good ROI?</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"c6a8h\">For mature tech companies that produce profits, the <a href=\"/terms/p/pe-ratio/\">price-to-earnings ratio</a> is a useful metric. Divide stock price by per-share earnings, and you get a multiple that tells you how highly the market values the company\'s current earnings. The higher the multiple, the more value the market is placing on future earnings growth.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"kvw16\">Many tech companies aren\'t profitable, so the price-to-earnings ratio isn\'t a good metric to evaluate them. Revenue growth matters more for younger companies. If you\'re investing in something unproven, you want to make sure it has solid growth prospects.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8g24d\">For unprofitable tech companies, it\'s also important that the bottom line be moving from losses toward profits. As a company grows, it should become more efficient, especially when it comes to the sales and marketing spending necessary to close deals. If it\'s not, or if spending is growing as a percentage of revenue, that could indicate something is wrong.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"tdpau\">Ultimately, a good tech stock is one that trades at a reasonable <a href=\"/terms/v/valuation/\">valuation</a>, given its growth prospects. Accurately figuring out those growth prospects is the hard part. If you expect earnings to skyrocket in the coming years, paying a premium for the stock can make sense. But if you\'re wrong about those growth prospects, your investment may not work out.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"600vl\">Investing in an <a href=\"/terms/e/etfs/\">exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a> that focuses on tech stocks is one way to avoid making mistakes. The <b>iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"208525\"><a href=\"/quote/nysemkt/igm/\">IGM</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.66%</span></span>) is a comprehensive option at a 0.41%<a href=\"/terms/e/etf-expense-ratio/\"> expense ratio</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"tedsj\">Investing in tech stocks can be risky, but you can reduce your risk by investing only when you feel confident their growth prospects justify their valuations.</p>\n                \n                \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

The key, of course, is to know which growth stocks to buy and when.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"dhz7z\">Despite increased volatility in the stock market in 2025, growth stocks continue to outperform. Through big highs and lows, the <b>S&amp;P 500 Growth index</b> climbed about 2% through the first five months of the year. Its counterpart, the <b>S&amp;P 500 Value index,</b> was down more than 1% during the same period.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5gi1g\">However, growth stocks don\'t always outperform during periods of volatility. In 2022, the S&amp;P 500 Growth index fell 30% for the year, while the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/sp-500/\">S&amp;P 500 index</a> dropped more than 19%.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ctv1l\">Picking the right growth stock can help you weather the downside while profiting in the long run from their potential. Here\'s a handy guide to help you get started investing in growth stocks. With these tools and strategies, you can position your portfolio for long-term success with growth stocks.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8f9t1\">Growth stocks are companies that increase their earnings faster than the average business in their industry or the market as a whole. Growth investing, however, involves more than picking stocks that are going up.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3jpdi\">Often, a growth company has developed an innovative product or service that is gaining share in existing markets, entering new markets, or even creating entirely new industries. The market tends to reward businesses that can grow faster than average for long periods, delivering handsome returns to <a href=\"/terms/s/shareholder/\">shareholders</a> in the process. The faster they grow, the bigger the potential returns.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"daunh\">Unlike <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/value-stocks/deep-value-stocks/\">value stocks</a>, high-growth stocks tend to be more expensive than the average in terms of <a href=\"/terms/p/profitability-ratios/\">profitability ratios</a>, such as <a href=\"/terms/p/pe-ratio/\">price-to-earnings</a>, <a href=\"/terms/p/price-to-sales-ratio-value-stocks/\">price-to-sales</a>, and <a href=\"/terms/p/price-to-free-cash-flow/\">price-to-free cash flow</a> ratios. Despite their premium price tags, the best growth stocks can still deliver fortune-creating returns to investors when they fulfill their awesome growth potential.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ftglv\">That said, growth stocks can be much more volatile. In 2022, they took a beating in the market. Despite strong performances in 2023 and 2024, the S&amp;P 500 Growth index total returns still lagged the returns of the broader index over the three-year period.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1mf80\">High <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/inflation/\">inflation</a> puts pressure on growth stocks because it reduces the future value of their expected earnings. <a href=\"/terms/s/supply-chain/\">Supply chain</a> constraints also affect the ability of some to expand, and other <a href=\"/terms/m/macroeconomic/\">macroeconomic factors</a> slow the entire economy. However, downturns can give long-term investors a buying opportunity when growth stock prices are low.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8adaj\">To provide you with some examples, here are 10 excellent growth stocks available in the stock market today.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"s8liy\">As this list shows, growth stocks come in all shapes and sizes. They can be found in a variety of industries, both within the U.S. and international markets. Although all the stocks on this list are larger businesses, smaller companies can be fertile ground for growth investors, too.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5addk\">A great way to invest in a wide variety of <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/small-cap-stocks/\">small-cap</a> growth stocks is via an <a href=\"/terms/e/etfs/\">exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF), such as <b>Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"221804\"><a href=\"/quote/nysemkt/vbk/\">VBK</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.28%</span></span>). This fund tracks the performance of the<b> CRSP U.S. Small Cap Growth Index</b>, which gives investors an easy way to invest in roughly 570 small-cap growth companies all at once.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6r6ek\">The Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF has an ultra-low <a href=\"/terms/e/etf-expense-ratio/\">expense ratio</a> of 0.07%. This means investors will receive almost all the fund\'s returns, with only a small amount in fees going to Vanguard. (An annual expense ratio of 0.07% works out to only $0.70 in fees per $1,000 invested annually.)</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"mo17\">To find great growth stocks, you\'ll need to:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"227fp\">Companies that capitalize on powerful long-term trends can increase their sales and profits for many years, generating wealth for their shareholders along the way. Here are some examples, along with the companies that can help you profit from those trends:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6phb2\">As more people shop online, <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-amazon-stock/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-shopify-stock/\">Shopify</a>, and <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-etsy-stock/\"><b>Etsy</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"335084\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/etsy/\">ETSY</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -1.03%</span></span>) are well positioned to profit within the U.S. (and many international markets). <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-mercadolibre-stock/\">MercadoLibre</a> holds a leading share of the online retail market in Latin America.

Amazon\'s and Google\'s cloud infrastructure services help make this possible, while <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-salesforce-stock/\">Salesforce</a> provides some of the best cloud-based enterprise software available. The rise of <a href=\"/terms/a/artificial-intelligence/\">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> will require vast amounts of computing power that cloud providers are ready, willing, and able to offer.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"f1v7b\">Millions are canceling their cable subscriptions and replacing them with less expensive and more convenient <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/media-stocks/streaming-service-stocks/\">streaming options</a>. As the global leader in streaming entertainment, Netflix offers a great way to profit from this trend, but it faces growing competition from other <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/media-stocks/big-6/\">media companies</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1o6cv\">The world is shifting from its reliance on gasoline to using electricity to power vehicles. According to a survey of industry executives, half of all auto sales could be <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/automotive-stocks/electric-car-stocks/\">electric vehicles</a> (EVs) by 2030. <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-tesla-stock/\"><b>Tesla</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"224257\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/tsla/\">TSLA</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.76%</span></span>) has been the leader in the space with its lineup of vehicles and <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/automotive-stocks/electric-vehicle-battery-stocks/\">battery technology</a>.

However, Alphabet\'s Waymo has a clear lead in the space, offering a commercial service in several U.S. cities and completing more than 250,000 rides per week. <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-uber-stock/\">Uber</a> has emerged as a key partner for autonomous vehicle companies looking to deploy their fleet and maximize their capital utilization, and it could be a hidden beneficiary of the growing number of self-driving cars on the road.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ceb8h\">Companies have recently poured billions into accelerating their AI development and applying it to their businesses. <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-nvidia-stock/\">Nvidia</a> has been a big beneficiary since it designs the chips used to train many <a href=\"/terms/l/large-language-models/\">large language models</a> (the foundation of <a href=\"/terms/g/generative-ai/\">generative AI</a>).</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"fum3s\">Alphabet, Amazon, and <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-microsoft-stock/\"><b>Microsoft</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204577\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/msft/\">MSFT</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.22%</span></span>) also benefit from growth in AI applications since many run on their cloud computing platforms. Salesforce is leveraging its position in enterprise software to help companies use their own data to create AI-powered agents.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"mft2\">The key is to try investing in these trends and companies as early as possible. The earlier you get in, the more you stand to profit. However, the most powerful trends can last for many years -- even decades -- giving you plenty of time to claim your share of the profits they create.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"7n3k5\">It\'s also important to invest in growth companies that possess strong <a href=\"/terms/c/competitive-advantage/\">competitive advantages</a>. Otherwise, their competitors may pass them, and their growth may not last long.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3v34a\">Competitive advantages become especially important during turbulent times, such as during a pandemic or periods of high inflation. A strong competitive advantage will help companies survive and thrive through market downturns, while those without one will struggle.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6o1k5\">We saw a big sell-off in many <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/\">tech-focused</a> growth stocks in 2022. Many top growth stocks\' share prices were slashed by more than 50%, but some of the biggest stock market losers of the year turned out to be the biggest winners in 2023 and 2024.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5qbca\">If you can identify stocks of companies with strong competitive advantages being sold off along with the rest of the market, it can be an opportunity to generate massive returns as they recover. Some competitive advantages are:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"fkh5p\">Growth stocks offer some of the highest return potential of all the companies available in the stock market. As is the case with any individual stock pick, the reason to invest in a growth stock is that you expect it to outperform the overall market. Better yet, if you can find a growth stock trading at a price that mitigates the inherent risks involved in investing in growth stocks, you can do very well with your investment in the long run.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"asqs9\">The appeal of growth stocks over value stocks and those paying high dividends is that the company\'s management is given more freedom and flexibility to invest in new opportunities. Without demands on its capital or as much pressure on quarterly profits, management may take a long-term view to grow the value of the business. That will ultimately benefit <a href=\"/terms/b/buy-and-hold-strategy/\">buy-and-hold investors</a> who patiently stick with the company as it builds the business.</p>\n<p>These acronyms symbolize five prominent tech companies essential to the S&amp;P 500.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Some growth tech stocks have been shrinking, but there are still good deals out there.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Get a list of the best companies to buy and hold for the long haul.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Learn about stock volatility and which stock market sectors are the most volatile right now.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"fpq7i\">Finally, you\'ll want to invest in businesses with large addressable markets and long runways for growth still ahead. Industry reports from research firms -- such as <b>Gartner</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204070\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/it/\">IT</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.12%</span></span>) and Insider Intelligence, which provide estimates of industry sizes, projections for growth, and market share figures -- can be very helpful.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"992ot\">The larger the opportunity, the larger a business can ultimately become. And the earlier in its growth cycle it is, the longer it can continue to grow at an impressive rate.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"ia9kl\">Growth stocks are shares of companies expected to increase their revenue and earnings faster than the average business in their industry or the market as a whole. They generally trade for high price multiples and experience more price volatility than the average stock.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"bmrbm\">The stock market prices future expectations for each company into its stock price. If a company exceeds expectations, it\'ll likely see its stock price increase. So, the stocks expected to rise the most in 2025 are those that outperform market expectations.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"bmrbm\">One example of a growth stock is Amazon. Its shares are usually considered expensive by traditional valuation measures, like price-to-earnings (P/E) or price-to-sales (P/S) ratios. However, the company continuously invests to grow its business and expand into new markets and industries. The long-term potential profit remains extremely high.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"4x2m3\">The best stocks for growth are usually smaller companies with unique competitive advantages in large or potentially large addressable markets. They are typically expensive relative to their peers, but the company\'s upside justifies the stock price.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"91tie\">What is the difference between a growth stock and a value stock.</p>\n        \n<p data-block-key=\"6zobx\">Growth stocks tend to exhibit faster and less predictable revenue growth compared to value stocks, which are much more predictable from year to year. Over the long run, growth stocks are expected to grow revenue and earnings much faster than value stocks. Value stocks typically trade based on their valuation, while growth stocks may trade on momentum and how their financial results and managements\' outlooks compare to expectations.</p>\n      \n<p><b>The Motley Fool: What\'s your best advice on finding high potential stocks like growth stocks?</b></p>\n<p><i>Dr. Cherry:</i> Because growth stocks tend to operate in a growth business cycle or business sector, finding high potential growth stocks should contain metrics that attempt to confirm or support current growth and best signal sustainable growth patterns. One important feature of a growth company is to ask, \"do they possess a unique business service or product in their sector that provides a valuable moat?\" This service or product is the lifeline of growth where the company needs to market, produce, deliver, and protect better than competitors and new entrants. Performance metrics to consider are whether the company shows historical increases in earnings over select periods and profit margin analysis, which illustrates how a company can manage costs and increase revenues. Other analysis considerations are the technical chart trend characteristics and experienced market analysts\' forward growth and price projections.<br></p>\n<p><b>The Motley Fool: Are growth stocks risky?</b></p>\n<p><i>Dr. Cherry:</i> Investing in individual stocks, in general, contains risk factors such as overall market risk and business risk, among others. The characteristics of growth stocks can make them <i>riskier</i> than their value stock counterparts. As their name suggests, growth stock companies tend to be in a <i>growing</i> business phase. The growing stage could consist of younger and smaller companies with an unproven product or entity track record that tend to use much of their revenues and raised capital to <i>grow</i> the business. These growth characteristics, among others, tend to make growth stocks riskier through higher stock price volatility or reactions to market, company, economic, and political risks, to name a few, thus more significant exposure to downside stock price pressure. However, as investors should avail themselves of the downside cautions of growth stock risk, the upside potential should also be considered. With additional risk comes the prospect of added returns. Because growth companies have the potential for higher company growth rates, growing from earlier business stages to mature business stages, growth stocks could potentially experience higher returns over shorter time horizons. Above all, investors should consider their risk tolerance, capacity, portfolio allocations, and goals to accept the higher risk of growth stocks.<br></p>\n<p><b>The Motley Fool: How do you tell the difference between a growth vs. value stock?</b></p>\n<p><i>Dr. Cherry:</i> Growth and value stocks tend to differ in a few areas, such as company size, business stage, and revenues to return gains to the shareholder. Growth stocks tend to be in the emerging markets or small or mid-cap company size areas whereas value stock companies tend to be large-cap. The size of companies tends to be the lens of what business stage a company resides. Growth stocks tend to be in the early to mid-business stages, the growth stages (although a small segment of large companies can be growth companies too), and value stock companies tend to be larger, more mature business stage companies. The value stock companies tend to be trading at a discount, \"on-sale,\" or a premium, \"overvalued,\" to their valuation, thus their name, finding <i>value.</i> Growth stock companies tend to reinvest their earnings back into the company and return value to shareholders solely through stock price appreciation. In comparison, value companies may return earnings to investors through a dividend, representing income to an investor and complements stock price appreciation. This income and stock price appreciation mean a total return approach.</p>\n      \n<p><b>The Motley Fool: How do you tell the difference between a growth vs. value stock?</b></p>\n<p><i>Dr. Stewart:</i> The Gordon valuation model is an excellent tool to illustrate the difference between growth and value stocks. Professor Gordon’s model, with some simplifying assumptions, shows that stock prices equal next year’s earnings (e) divided by the expression r – g, where “r” is a discount rate and “g” is a growth rate. For the same stock price, a lower growth rate necessitates a higher earnings number. Conversely, (illustrated by dividing both sides by e) a high-p/e stock is associated with a high growth rate. Of course, these numbers reflect investor expectations.</p>\n<p>Investors bid up the p/e ratios of some stocks because, despite low current earnings relative to their market values, they expect earnings to grow at high rates. These are traditionally defined as growth stocks. Tesla stock is a good example of a growth stock, with its 154 p/e multiple and 73% earnings growth rate (using Yahoo Finance data).</p>\n<p><b>The Motley Fool: Are growth stocks risky?</b></p>\n<p><i>Dr. Stewart:</i> Note that a company’s risk is embedded in its discount rate “r.” As a result, companies with stable earnings will justify higher p/e multiples than ones with volatile earnings, other things equal. Clorox, a large-cap, stable-earnings company with only modest growth expectations (basically 0% using Yahoo Finance data) still justifies a p/e of 30 (using next fiscal year’s earnings).</p>\n<p>Empirical evidence suggests that high-growth stocks underperform low-growth, low-p/e “value” stocks over the very long term. For example, the Russell small-cap Value index yielded roughly 3% a year higher than its Growth peer over the forty years ending 2019, and at lower return volatility. One explanation is that investors over-estimate the sustainability of high-growing companies since these “glamour” stocks subsequently fail to deliver on those high expectations. However, there can be long periods in which growth stocks outperform, such as the 10 years ending 2020.</p>\n<p>The theory and evidence suggest that the key to picking good growth stocks is to identify the ones whose earnings growth rates will accelerate in the short term (increasing the p/e and price) and not disappoint in the long term (sustaining e growth and maintaining a high p/e). For value stocks, some practitioners suggest picking companies that investors have given up on (ones with very low-p/e or other multiples if e is less than zero), that won’t fail in the short-term and will recover in the long-term. Not easy tasks!</p>\n      \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

They are fairly simple to understand and can generate impressive returns without much expense or effort. Here\'s what you should know about ETFs, how they work, and how to buy them.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"ee8gn\">An ETF allows investors to buy many stocks or bonds at once. People buy shares of ETFs, and the money is invested according to a certain objective. For example, if you buy an <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/sp-500/etfs/\"><b>S&amp;P 500</b> ETF</a>, your money will be invested proportionately in the 500 companies in that index, and your investment\'s performance should roughly match that of the index over time.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"kxkas\">One common question is how <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/etf-vs-mutual-fund/\">ETFs differ from mutual funds</a>, since the basic principle is the same. The key difference between these two types of investment vehicles is how you buy and sell them. <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/mutual-funds/\">Mutual funds</a> are priced once per day, and you typically invest a set dollar amount. For example, you might place an order to buy $1,000 of a certain mutual fund.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1qjc7\">Mutual funds can be purchased through a brokerage or directly from the issuer. The key point is that the transaction is not instantaneous.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"e5x1p\">ETFs, on the other hand, trade just like stocks on major exchanges such as the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/exchange/nyse/\">New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</a> or the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/exchange/nasdaq/\">Nasdaq Stock Market</a>. Instead of investing a specific dollar amount, you simply buy shares of the ETF like you would any stock.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"4r518\">Because they trade like stocks, ETF share prices continuously fluctuate throughout the trading day, and you can buy shares of ETFs whenever the stock market is open. With many brokers, you might even be able to buy ETFs when the market is closed.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"cc4om\">Before we get any further, there are a few concepts that are important to know before you buy your first ETFs.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7tai9\">If you buy ETFs in a standard brokerage account (i.e., not a <a href=\"/retirement/plans/ira/how-to-invest-in-ira/\">retirement account</a>), you should know that they could result in taxable income. Any gains you make from selling an ETF will be taxed according to <a href=\"/terms/c/capital-gains-tax/\">capital gains tax</a> rules, and any dividends you receive will likely be taxable as well.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3p7vm\">Of course, if you invest in ETFs through an <a href=\"/retirement/plans/ira/\">individual retirement account (IRA)</a>, you won\'t have to worry about capital gains or <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/how-dividends-taxed/\">dividend taxes</a>. In a <a href=\"/retirement/plans/ira/benefits/\">traditional IRA</a>, money in the account is considered taxable income only after it is withdrawn, while <a href=\"/retirement/plans/roth-ira/\">Roth IRA</a> investments aren\'t taxable at all in most cases.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1hgr7\">ETFs don\'t have minimum investment requirements -- at least not in the same sense that mutual funds do. However, ETFs trade on a per-share basis. Unless your broker offers the ability to <a href=\"/terms/f/what-are-fractional-shares/\">buy fractional shares of stock</a>, which is becoming more common, you\'ll need at least the current price of one share to get started.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6esjj\">Let\'s look at some pros and cons of investing in ETFs.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"52tb1\">You might notice that this list is heavy on Vanguard and Schwab. There\'s a good reason: Both are dedicated to offering easy access to the stock market at a minimal expense, so ETFs from both tend to be among the cheapest in the business.</p>\n<p>ETFs can help eliminate risk because they tend to be less volatile than individual stocks and give exposure to a range of assets.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Your investment style can dictate which kind of fund is best for your portfolio.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Index funds track a particular index and can be a good way to invest. Get a fast introduction to index funds here.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>Exchange-traded funds are popular with investors. Check out the largest ETF issuers, their ETF brands, and how much they charge in</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"emq4f\">It\'s important to keep in mind that ETFs are generally designed to be maintenance-free investments. Newer investors tend to have a bad habit of checking their portfolios far too often and making <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/stock-market-anxiety/\">emotional, knee-jerk reactions</a> to major market moves.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5f5cr\">In fact, the average fund investor<i> significantly</i> underperforms the market over time, and overtrading is the main reason. So, once you buy shares of some great ETFs, the best plan is to <i>leave them alone</i> and let them do what they\'re intended to do: produce excellent investment growth over long periods of time.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"72ysf\"><b>The Motley Fool: Are ETFs good for beginner investors?</b></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bof5n\"><i>Dr. A. Seddik Meziani:</i> ETFs are an easy way to invest. They are rightly considered an ideal entry point into the market for fledgling investors thanks to their simplicity, low upfront cost, simple fee structure, and ease of trade. Also, beyond an ETF share price, there is no minimum amount to invest, unlike for mutual funds. Any broker can turn an investor into a new ETF holder via a straightforward brokerage account. Investors can easily access the market or submarket they want to be in. It is easily done through an ETF that tracks it.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"8lp1\"></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6bmd3\"><b>The Motley Fool: Is an ETF considered safer than an index fund to mitigate risk? Or vice versa?</b></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"aidin\"><i>Dr. A. Seddik Meziani:</i> To be clear, many ETFs are an “index fund” in that they also track an index, just with different terms and conditions. That being said, most ETFs can be used to mitigate risk since they are generally inherently diversified via their underlying baskets of securities which offer a widening range of asset classes. Like index funds, they cannot, however, fully eliminate risk such as market risk or counterparty and credit risk inherent in an ETF structure.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7p1pb\"></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bes36\"><b>The Motley Fool: Are ETFs considered safer than stocks? Why or why not?</b></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6nmad\"><i>Dr. A. Seddik Meziani:</i> ETFs are generally considered safer to own than individual stocks because of their wide array of underlying holdings which provide the benefits of diversification. Generally, it’s safer to hold a group of stocks rather than just one stock. In other words, ETFs eliminate exposure to individual securities risk.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bhva\"></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9sgu\"><b>The Motley Fool: How do ETFs help with diversification? Is it possible to over-diversify your ETF portfolio?</b></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"b12a\"><i>Dr. A. Seddik Meziani:</i> Diversification is a widely accepted framework for managing investments. ETFs help with diversification especially if the underlying portfolios include multiple asset classes. But like everything else, diversification also has its limits. It should be practiced in moderation. The role of diversification is to reduce investment risk. Taking it too far, however, could lead to portfolio bloat and overdiversification. It happens when the additional benefit of reducing risk via diversification begins to be outweighed by the marginal loss of the expected return. Holding more stocks simply for the sake of having more holdings and not thinking about how the risk of each additional stock balances against the risk of the existing stocks is not a good investment strategy.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"ifeyi\">An exchange-traded fund, or ETF, allows investors to buy many stocks or bonds at once. People buy shares of ETFs, and the money is invested according to a certain objective.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9quir\">ETFs trade just like stocks on major exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. Because they trade like stocks, ETF prices continuously fluctuate throughout the trading day, and you can buy shares of ETFs whenever the stock market is open.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"32r9h\"><b>Steps to investing in ETFs:</b></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ddnd9\">An ETF\'s expense ratio indicates how much of your investment in a fund will be deducted annually as fees. A fund\'s expense ratio equals the fund\'s operating expenses divided by the average assets of the fund. To be clear, this isn\'t a fee you\'ll have to pay -- it will be reflected in the ETF\'s performance over time.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"00638\">The 3:5-10 rule (also known as the 3-5-10 limits) is a regulatory guideline for ETFs and other investment funds that restricts the amount they can own in another fund\'s voting shares. The breakdown is:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"00638\">You should aim to hold most ETFs indefinitely. These funds are long-term investment vehicles that typically hold a diversified group of stocks, bonds, or other assets. A good rule of thumb is to only sell an ETF if you want to invest the money into a higher-performing or lower-risk fund or if you need the money for something else (e.g., down payment on a house or retirement).</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"00638\">Many ETFs provide some form of diversification. Some ETFs hold a wide selection of stocks (e.g., all companies in a market index), while others provide diversification across different stock types (i.e., dividend, value, or growth stocks).</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ef885\">However, not all ETFs provide diversification. Some thematic funds only hold stocks in a certain sector (e.g., <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/energy-etfs/\">energy</a> or tech) while some only invest in one asset (a specific stock or other asset class like <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/materials/gold-stocks/gold-etfs/\">gold</a>).</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"00638\">The main difference between an index fund and ETFs lies in how they trade. ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange throughout the trading day. Index funds typically only price once a day, usually at market close. Other differences are liquidity (it\'s easier to buy and sell ETFs than index funds), fees (some ETFs have higher fees), and investment minimum (some index funds require you to invest a specific minimum amount, like $1,000).</p>\n      \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

Investing in an index fund is less risky than investing in individual stocks or bonds because index funds often hold hundreds of <a href=\"/terms/s/securities/\">financial securities</a>. Index funds spread your investment risk across the stocks or bonds of many different individual companies.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"8gj8g\">Index funds hold baskets of investments that track a market index, such as the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/sp-500/\"><b>S&amp;P 500</b></a> (<a href=\"/quote/snpindex/^gspc/\">SNPINDEX:^GSPC</a>). They are <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/active-vs-passive-investing/\">passively managed</a>, meaning the fund\'s holdings are entirely determined by the index the fund tracks.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5or98\">The goal of an index fund is to match the performance of the underlying index. They\'re a good choice for <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/investment-strategies/\">long-term investors</a> because you can lock in the returns of the overall stock market or a specific segment of it.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"93p68\">The returns generated by an index fund generally never exceed the performance of the index itself, if only because of index fund <a href=\"/terms/e/expense-ratio/\">expense ratio</a>s, which are the annual management fees collected by index fund managers. Since index funds are passively managed, they are actually more likely to outperform funds with active managers over the long term.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"fnda5\">An index fund can be either a <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/etf-vs-mutual-fund/\">mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF), both of which are managed by investment advisers who have to register with the <a href=\"/terms/s/sec/\">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a>. Investors buy shares of mutual funds directly from asset management companies, while shares in ETFs are purchased and sold through stock exchanges.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"4bcaq\">Consider these key factors when picking an index fund to invest in:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"eso31\">Our picks for the eight best <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/index-funds/\">index funds</a> for this year can help you accomplish a variety of investment goals. Plus, they have low expense ratios and low minimum investments.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9988t\">After a rocky 2022, many of the funds listed below rebounded significantly in 2023 and 2024. As the stock markets have reacted to economic uncertainty, particularly fears of a growing trade war due to President Trump\'s tariffs, many of the funds on this list have dipped again in early 2025. But remember: Index investing is about <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/how-to-build-wealth/\">building wealth</a> for the long haul, so try not to focus on short-term ups and downs.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"99bj3\">Investing in S&amp;P 500 index funds is, perhaps, the closest thing to a guaranteed way to build wealth over time. The <b>Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund</b> (<a href=\"/quote/nasdaqmutfund/fnil.x/\">NASDAQMUTFUND:FNIL.X</a>) tracks an index of more than 500 U.S. <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/large-cap-stocks/\">large-cap stocks</a> and performs very similarly to an S&amp;P 500 index fund.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"477e\">However, because this fund is not an official S&amp;P 500 index fund, it avoids paying expensive licensing fees to <b>S&amp;P Global</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204461\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/spgi/\">SPGI</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.54%</span></span>), the index\'s parent company. The fund tracks the <b>Fidelity U.S. Large Cap Index</b> as its benchmark.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2imka\">The \"ZERO\" in the fund\'s name denotes that its expense ratio is 0%. There\'s also no minimum investment, making the fund a good choice for <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/beginner-stocks/\">beginning investors</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"quo2e\">The fund\'s performance closely mirrors that of the S&amp;P 500. The fund was down almost 4% as of mid-March 2025, almost identical to the S&amp;P 500 index\'s year-to-date drop.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"1mk4e\">If you want to invest in an official S&amp;P 500 index fund, the <b>Schwab S&amp;P 500 Index Fund</b> (<a href=\"/quote/nasdaqmutfund/swpp.x/\">NASDAQMUTFUND:SWPP.X</a>) is about the cheapest you\'ll find. Its expense ratio is 0.02%, meaning you\'ll pay just $0.20 annually for every $1,000 you invest.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"4rbmg\">Because the investment fee is so low, your returns are virtually identical to the performance of the S&amp;P 500. There\'s no minimum investment amount, so you can start investing with as little as $1.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3tkj7\">In 2022, the fund fell more than 18%, almost identical to the S&amp;P 500\'s losses for the year. Like its benchmark index, the fund had gains of about 25% in 2024 but had fallen by almost 4% in early 2025.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"79kej\">If you want to assume more investment risk in the pursuit of higher rewards, the <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/how-to-invest-in-vug-etf/\"><b>Vanguard Growth ETF</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"221816\"><a href=\"/quote/nysemkt/vug/\">VUG</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.17%</span></span>) is a solid choice. The fund tracks the <b>CRSP US Large Cap Growth Index</b>, which performs similarly to the <b>S&amp;P 500 Growth Index</b>. The ETF invests in 180 U.S. large-cap <a href=\"/terms/g/growth-stock/\">growth stocks</a>. The fund is most heavily concentrated in the following sectors:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"4gr4q\"><a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-staples/\">Consumer staples</a> and <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/utilities/\">utility stocks</a> each make up less than 1% of the fund\'s value. The ETF has a minuscule 0.04% expense ratio. As early spring 2025, the fund\'s average annual return over five years (before taxes) was almost 19% compared to about 17% for the S&amp;P 500. As tech stocks slumped in early 2025, the Vanguard Growth ETF dropped by almost 8%, about double the losses posted by the S&amp;P 500.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"eudnp\">The <b>SPDR S&amp;P Dividend ETF </b>(<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"208835\"><a href=\"/quote/nysemkt/sdy/\">SDY</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.13%</span></span>) is a top-performing index fund for <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/income-stocks/\">income-oriented investors</a>. The dividend-weighted fund\'s benchmark is the <b>S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats</b>®<b> Index</b>, which tracks 135 stocks with the highest dividend yields in the <b>S&amp;P Composite 1500</b> <b>Index</b>. (Dividend Aristocrats® is a registered trademark of Standard &amp; Poor\'s Financial Services LLC.)</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"39t53\">All the companies owned by the ETF have increased their dividend payments annually for at least 25 consecutive years.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5lmp4\">Dividend-paying stocks tend to be less volatile compared to the overall stock market. So it\'s unsurprising that the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Dividend ETF underperformed compared to the S&amp;P 500 in 2023 and 2024 or that it outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the early months of 2025, with modest gains of about 2.5% as of mid-March.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7or9b\">The fund\'s 30-day SEC yield as of mid-March 2025 was 2.57% -- significantly higher than the S&amp;P 500\'s 1.23%. The expense ratio is also somewhat higher at 0.35%. The fund\'s top five holdings are:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ba2e9\">Several <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/real-estate-investing/reit/\">real estate investment trusts (REITs)</a> are represented in the fund. REITs typically pay high dividends because they\'re required to disburse at least 90% of their taxable income. The ETF is underweighted in tech stocks, which don\'t tend to pay generous dividends.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"dtu4s\">If you want to invest across <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/real-estate-investing/\">the real estate market</a>, the <b>Vanguard Real Estate ETF</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"221778\"><a href=\"/quote/nysemkt/vnq/\">VNQ</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.5%</span></span>) is a solid, low-cost option. With an expense ratio of 0.13%, it\'s also the largest real estate index fund by far, with total net assets of more than $67 billion.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"37jqu\">Its benchmark index is the <b>MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index</b>, which broadly tracks equity REITs in the U.S. Although the index includes a few real estate management and development companies, it consists mostly of <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/real-estate-investing/reit/equity-reit/\">equity REITs</a>, which own and operate income-producing real estate.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"3ugns\">Because it invests primarily in REITs, the ETF is also attractive to dividend investors. The fund\'s 12-month dividend yield as of mid-March 2025, was 3.81%. The Vanguard ETF may also appeal to investors concerned about inflation since real estate is traditionally seen as a hedge against rising prices elsewhere.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"asp2c\"></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"385fv\">The <b>Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"250173\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/vtwo/\">VTWO</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.18%</span></span>), which tracks the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/russell-2000/\"><b>Russell 2000</b></a>, is a good place to start for investors who want to take advantage of the potential upside of investing in <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/small-cap-stocks/\">small-cap companies</a>. The fund invests in about 1,970 small- and <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/mid-cap-stocks/\">mid-cap companies</a> with a median <a href=\"/terms/m/market-cap/\">market capitalization</a> of $3.2 billion.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"4r4am\">As of early March 2025, the index fund\'s largest concentrations were in industrials (19%), financials (18.9%), and healthcare (16.6%). At 0.1%, its expense ratio is relatively low, especially for a fund offering exposure to the companies with the most growth potential. Like its benchmark index, the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF dropped by more than 3% during the early part of 2025.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"fqndk\">Thematic investors wanting to capitalize on a long-term <a href=\"/terms/s/secular-trend/\">secular trend</a> should check out the <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/how-to-invest-in-robo-etf/\"><b>ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"288528\"><a href=\"/quote/nysemkt/robo/\">ROBO</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.03%</span></span>). The index fund\'s benchmark is the <b>Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index</b>, which tracks 77 robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI) companies. It has more than $985 million in total net assets and a 0.95% expense ratio, higher than any fund on this list.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"ahtv2\">The ETF offers investors a way to capture the growth of several booming trends. Robotics offers huge cost savings to companies; the industry is forecast to have a compound annual growth rate of 15.2% through 2032. Interest in <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/\">AI stocks</a> had also surged since late 2022, when <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a> launched. The ETF finished 2023 with a gain of almost 24% but sank about 2% in 2024. It had posted losses of just under 2% through early 2025, slightly less than the S&amp;P 500\'s losses.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"h1em\">If you want to <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/portfolio-diversification/\">diversify your portfolio</a> through exposure to high-growth emerging markets but don\'t want your risk concentrated in a single economy or region, the <b>Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"225338\"><a href=\"/quote/nysemkt/sche/\">SCHE</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.2%</span></span>) may be a good fit. It tracks the <b>FTSE Emerging Index</b>, a collection of large- and mid-cap stocks in more than 20 developing countries.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"d90uv\">The fund has 2,057 holdings, with the largest concentrations in China, India, Taiwan, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia. Its expense ratio is only 0.11%.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"dcpnu\">The stocks of companies in emerging markets have historically underperformed compared to U.S. stocks. In the past five years as of March 2025, the Schwab emerging market fund had annualized returns just shy of 5%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 racked up annualized returns of about 17% during the same five-year period.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6fagj\">The Schwab emerging market fund has been up slightly through mid-March, though, with year-to-date returns of about 2%, as international stocks have largely outperformed U.S. stocks in early 2025.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"dv660\">But considering about 85% of the world\'s population lives in developing countries, investors who have a long-term focus and are comfortable with volatility seriously may want to consider investing in this fund.</p>\n                \n                \n<p>These 8 top index funds pay dividends, too.

What is it, and how do you minimize it?</p>\n          \n        \n<p>More money has been lost waiting to buy stocks than in holding stocks through downturns.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"7os5a\"></p>\n<p data-block-key=\"57nl5\">There are two ways to make money from index funds: sell the investment for a gain or earn dividends. A growth-focused index fund, like the Vanguard Growth ETF, has the potential for big gains.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"96gm3\">However, higher rewards come with greater risk, and dividend payments will likely be minimal. If you want investment income, a dividend fund like the SPDR S&amp;P Dividend ETF is a good choice. There\'s less potential for big gains, but you can earn reliable dividend income.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"aoe0k\">Although there\'s no single best index fund to invest in, a couple of good options are an S&amp;P 500 index fund, which tracks about 80% of the U.S. stock market, or a total stock market fund, which tracks the entire U.S. stock market. These tend to be good choices because they\'re well diversified and allow you to lock in the historical growth of the domestic stock market.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"cm257\">All investments carry some risk, but S&amp;P 500 index funds have been historically <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/index-funds/safest-index-funds/\">safe investments</a> for the long term since the S&amp;P 500 has always delivered positive returns over long periods. The <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/sp-500/annual-returns/\">S&amp;P 500\'s average annual returns</a> are about 10%.</p>\n                \n                \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

Additionally, the company has limited exposure to private-label competition, bolstering its pricing power and margin resilience.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <div class=\"wrapper yf-eondll\" data-testid=\"inarticle-ad\">  <div id=\"sda-INARTICLE-6195f22f-4bba-3801-a701-15485968d007-1\" class=\"sdaContainer  dv-all sda-INARTICLE-6195f22f-4bba-3801-a701-15485968d007-1 yf-1m4k8v7 overflow margin  visible placeholder\" data-testid=\"ad-container\" data-ad-unit=\"/22888152279/us/yfin/ros/dt/us_yfin_ros_dt_mid_center\" data-ad-size=\"970x250,728x90,300x250,fluid\" data-ad-region=\"main-dynamic\" data-ad-loc=\"mid_center\" style=\"--placeholder-height: 250px;\"></div></div>   <p class=\"yf-1090901\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Mizuho’s industry review prompted valuation adjustments across several food stocks, but the analyst emphasized that BellRing retains structural advantages. The diversified flavor-infusion portfolio and robust growth in categories like shake-based nutrition offerings provide a foundation for sustained performance.

With ETFs, investors can own an <a href=\"/terms/a/assets/\">asset</a> that trades like a stock but gives them ownership of a broad range of stocks or other assets.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"kvyd7\">There are all kinds of ETFs available. Some track major indexes, such as the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/sp-500/\"><b>S&amp;P 500</b></a> or the <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/nasdaq/\"><b>Nasdaq Composite</b></a>. Others give investors exposure to certain parts of the world, like China or <a href=\"/terms/e/emerging-market-economy/\">emerging markets</a>. And some ETFs concentrate on certain sectors, such as technology or <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/bank-stocks/\">banking</a>, or specific types of stocks, like dividend or growth stocks.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"p4eyo\">In a challenging market environment, ETFs can help reduce one considerable risk of owning an individual <a href=\"/terms/s/stock/\">stock</a> since they tend to be less volatile. Although they\'re similar in principle to <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/mutual-funds/\">mutual funds</a>, they\'re easier to buy and trade than the typical mutual fund and tend to have <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/etf-vs-mutual-fund/\">lower fees</a>.

This lower expense ratio means investors will pay just $3 in annual fees for every $10,000 invested with the fund versus $78 in a typical competing fund.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"86t68\">The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF is one of the largest and most popular ETFs (it was the largest by <a href=\"/terms/a/aum/\">assets under management</a>, or AUM, in June 2025). The ETF\'s combination of low costs and large size makes it a great choice if you\'re looking to invest in the broader market. Because of its history, <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/portfolio-diversification/\">diversification</a>, and exposure to <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/blue-chip-stocks/\">blue chip stocks</a>, many investors consider it one of the best ETFs to <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/best-long-term-etfs/\">buy and hold</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"cefql\">The S&amp;P 500 has an excellent track record of delivering <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/indexes/sp-500/annual-returns/\">returns for investors</a>. Over the last 50 years, the <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/average-stock-market-return/\">average stock market return</a>, as measured by the S&amp;P 500, is 8% with <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/dividend-reinvestment/\">dividends reinvested</a>. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF is a low-cost way to capture the market\'s returns.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"mmrho\">If you\'re looking to gain exposure to big <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/\">tech stocks</a>, <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/how-to-invest-in-qqq-etf/\"><b>Invesco QQQ Trust</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"206254\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/qqq/\">QQQ</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.33%</span></span>) is an excellent choice. The ETF tracks the <a href=\"/terms/n/nasdaq-100/\"><b>Nasdaq-100</b></a> index, which includes 100 of the Nasdaq\'s largest nonfinancial companies.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9m4jg\">The top stocks in the ETF are <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-apple-stock/\"><b>Apple</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"202686\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/aapl/\">AAPL</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.53%</span></span>), <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-microsoft-stock/\"><b>Microsoft</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204577\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/msft/\">MSFT</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.26%</span></span>), and <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-amazon-stock/\"><b>Amazon</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"202816\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/amzn/\">AMZN</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.86%</span></span>), and it boasts an affordable expense ratio of 0.2%. It\'s one of the best-performing ETFs.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"efpju\">As of June 2025, the Invesco QQQ Trust had generated a total return of around 410% over the past decade. That easily outpaced the S&amp;P 500\'s roughly 235% return. A $10,000 investment made in the Invesco QQQ Trust 10 years ago would be worth more than $51,000 today.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5rmmu\">The Nasdaq-100\'s focus on innovative technology companies positions it to continue delivering strong total returns, especially as <a href=\"/terms/a/artificial-intelligence/\">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> accelerates growth in the tech sector in the coming years.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"mmrho\">If you want to invest in growth stocks but don\'t want to be an <a href=\"/terms/a/active-stock-picking/\">active stock picker</a>, the <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/how-to-invest-in-vug-etf/\"><b>Vanguard Growth ETF</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"221816\"><a href=\"/quote/nysemkt/vug/\">VUG</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.17%</span></span>) makes that easy. The ETF holds large-cap growth stocks and tracks the <b>CRSP US Large-Cap Growth</b> index.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ar806\">Like the Invesco QQQ Trust and the Vanguard 500 Index, the Vanguard Growth ETF\'s biggest holdings are Apple and Microsoft. The growth-focused ETF also holds many other growth stocks among the roughly 165 companies in the fund as of June 2025.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"5hd2t\">The Vanguard Growth ETF offers a rock-bottom expense ratio of just 0.04%. Its low cost makes it a good deal for anyone looking for a <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/growth-stocks/growth-etf/\">growth stock ETF</a>.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"mmrho\">The <b>iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"208645\"><a href=\"/quote/nysemkt/ijr/\">IJR</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.16%</span></span>) provides broad exposure to <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/small-cap-stocks/\">small-cap stocks</a>. Small caps tend to be more volatile than the broader market because they may not be profitable or as financially strong as their <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/large-cap-stocks/\">large-cap</a> counterparts. As a result, small caps tend to be riskier during a downturn because they may not have the same access to capital.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bbjgg\">This ETF helps mute some of that risk by owning a large basket of small caps. As of June 2025, it held about 635 stocks and had a fairly low concentration of holdings. Its top 10 holdings made up about 6.6% of the total. The ETF has a very low expense ratio of 0.06%, making it a low-cost way to add some small-cap exposure to your portfolio.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"nu406\"><a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/how-to-invest-in-dividend-stocks/\">Dividend stocks</a> are great long-term investments. Over the last 50 years, dividend-paying companies outperformed those that don\'t pay dividends by more than 2-to-1 (9.2% average annual total return versus 4.3% for dividend nonpayers). The best performance came from dividend growers and initiators (10.2% versus 6.8% for companies with no change in their dividend policy).</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"67mte\">The <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/how-to-invest-in-schd-etf/\"><b>Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"255345\"><a href=\"/quote/nysemkt/schd/\">SCHD</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.28%</span></span>) provides exposure to high-yielding U.S. stocks with a history of growing their <a href=\"/terms/d/dividends-per-share/\">dividends per share</a>. It tracks an index (<b>Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index</b>) that measures the performance of 100 top dividend stocks based on several quality characteristics. Notable holdings in mid-2025 included <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-coca-cola-stock/\"><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204186\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/ko/\">KO</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.06%</span></span>), <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-verizon-stock/\"><b>Verizon</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"206030\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/vz/\">VZ</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.74%</span></span>), and <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-chevron-stock/\"><b>Chevron</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"203255\"><a href=\"/quote/nyse/cvx/\">CVX</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.03%</span></span>).</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"fgg82\">The ETF offers a relatively attractive <a href=\"/terms/d/dividend-yield/\">dividend yield</a>. As of June 2025, it had a <a href=\"/terms/t/ttm/\">trailing 12-month</a> yield of 4%, more than triple the 1.3% dividend yield of an S&amp;P 500 index fund. And thanks to its low expense ratio of 0.06%, investors get to keep more of the <a href=\"/terms/d/dividend-income/\">dividend income</a> the ETF produces. The fund should also deliver price appreciation as the underlying companies grow their earnings and dividends.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"c2m5r\">Although the S&amp;P 500 is considered a broad-market index, it gives you exposure to only 500 large-cap U.S. stocks. If you want to own all the stocks in the U.S. market, the best way to do it is through a total stock market fund such as the <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/how-to-invest-in-vanguard-total-stock-market-etf-vti/\"><b>Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF</b></a> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"221774\"><a href=\"/quote/nysemkt/vti/\">VTI</a> <span class=\"text-green-900 ticker-change\"> 0.23%</span></span>).</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"9862c\">As of June 2025, the fund held more than 3,550 stocks, including <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/large-cap-stocks/\">large-cap</a>, <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/mid-cap-stocks/\">mid-cap</a>, and small-cap stocks. Because its holdings encompass the S&amp;P 500, its largest holdings are the same as for the broad market index.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"96kq0\">Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF aims to track the <b>CRSP US Total Stock Market</b> index. Like other Vanguard funds, its low expense ratio of 0.03% makes it an affordable way to invest in the entire U.S. stock market through one ETF.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"nu406\">If it\'s <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/international-stocks/\">international markets</a> you want, the <b>iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF</b> (<span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"287761\"><a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/ixus/\">IXUS</a> <span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.05%</span></span>) is a good way to go. The fund derives its holdings from an MSCI global index and subtracts the U.S. listings. It held almost 4,250 stocks, including large caps, mid caps, and small caps from around the world.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7qobs\">The ETF offers diversified international exposure. The fund\'s top five geographies as of June 2025 were:</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6i7hc\">The iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF allows you to invest globally at an affordable expense ratio of 0.07%. It also has an attractive dividend yield of 3%, based on dividend payments over the last 12 months (as of mid-2025).</p>\n<p>Exchange-traded funds let an investor buy many stocks and bonds at once in a single transaction.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>The ARK Space Exploration &amp; Innovation ETF is a great choice for investors looking to benefit from the burgeoning space economy.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust, or SPY ETF, is the oldest ETF in the U.S. Learn how to invest in this S&amp;P 500 index fund.</p>\n          \n        \n<p>If you want exposure to hundreds of small-cap stocks, the easiest way is with a Russell 2000 ETF. Discover the top 5 here.</p>\n          \n        \n<p data-block-key=\"d3o9g\">Exchange-traded funds can work for almost any kind of investor, regardless of your <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/active-vs-passive-investing/\">investing style</a> or the type of stocks you\'re looking to invest in. Hundreds of ETFs offer exposure to a wide range of sectors and different investing goals, such as dividends or growth.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"e9akt\">With these funds, you can avoid some of the risk and volatility of investing in individual stocks at a very low cost. They\'re also a good idea if there\'s a <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/investing-in-sector-etfs/\">sector</a> you want to invest in but don\'t know it well enough to pick individual stocks.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"ci9oq\">For most investors, holding at least one or two ETFs makes sense, especially if you want to eliminate some of the work of picking individual stocks. The list above offers a good start if you\'re looking for some of the best ETFs to buy.</p>\n                \n                \n<p data-block-key=\"1m5ia\">There are lots of good ETFs to buy in any market environment. In June 2025, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF looked relatively more attractive than other top ETFs.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"7r8li\">Its price had underperformed the market over the past year (down slightly over the past year by the end of May, compared to a more than 10% increase for the Vanguard 500 ETF and a 15% rally in the Invesco QQQ Trust). Because of that, the dividend-focused ETF offers an attractive dividend yield (4%) and strong long-term appreciation potential as its holdings grow their earnings, which will support rising dividends and stock prices.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"xtflu\">The most successful ETF over the last 10 years is the <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/how-to-invest-in-smh-etf/\"><b>VanEck Semiconductor ETF</b></a> (<a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/smh/\">NASDAQ:SMH</a>). The fund focuses on <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/semiconductor-stocks/\">semiconductor stocks</a> and has delivered a 24.1% average annualized total return over the past decade. Of note, three of the 10 best-performing ETFs over the last decade focused on semiconductors, while all of the top 10 performers focused on <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/tech-etfs/\">technology stocks</a>.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"gbcnm\">ETFs are great for beginners because they take the guesswork out of picking individual stocks. The best ETF for beginners is one focused on the broader market.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"1agct\">Top options include the S&amp;P 500-focused Vanguard 500 ETF or the even broader Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF. Both own hundreds of stocks, have low expense ratios, and provide investors instant exposure to a diversified portfolio of stocks for a very reasonable cost.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"a1gqd\">ETFs can be very good investments. Many ETFs enable you to invest passively in a broader stock market index at a low cost, allowing you to earn market returns.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"bsptl\">Other ETFs are great options for those seeking <a href=\"/terms/p/passive-income/\">passive income</a> from dividend stocks or bonds. ETFs can also help investors earn market-beating returns by investing in a sector or group of stocks growing at above-average rates (like semiconductor or technology stocks).</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"a1gqd\">According to data from ETFdb.com, dozens of ETFs offer dividend yields in the double digits as of mid-2025. However, many of the ETFs with the highest dividends are very small <a href=\"/terms/l/leveraged-etfs/\">leveraged ETFs</a>, making them exceptionally risky.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"2qto2\">Even so, a couple of high-dividend ETFs stood out for yield-seeking investors: the <b>Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF</b> (<a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/qyld/\">NASDAQ:QYLD</a>) and the <a href=\"/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/how-to-invest-in-jepq-etf/\"><b>JPMorgan</b> <b>Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF</b></a> (<a href=\"/quote/nasdaq/jepq/\">NASDAQ:JEPQ</a>). Both used a <a href=\"/terms/c/covered-call/\">covered call</a> strategy to generate options income on a well-known market index (Nasdaq-100), enabling them to pay yields of about 10%.</p>\n      \n<p data-block-key=\"o79dl\">Some ETFs are safer than stocks. For example, investing in a broad market ETF like the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF or the Vanguard Total Market ETF holds 500 or more stocks. That provides investors with a lot more diversification than they\'d typically have in a portfolio of stocks they selected. Meanwhile, some ETFs invest in lower-risk assets like bonds or dividend-paying stocks.</p>\n<p data-block-key=\"6v5km\">However, some ETFs are riskier than stocks. For example, a leveraged ETF can be very volatile. Meanwhile, some ETFs invest in riskier assets like commodities (<a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/oil-stocks/oil-etf-stocks/\">oil</a> and <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/natural-gas-stocks/natural-gas-etfs/\">natural gas</a>) using futures contracts, which are costly to manage, affecting the fund\'s long-term returns.</p>\n      \n<p class=\"font-bold uppercase text-md mb-20px text-gray-1100\">Related Articles</p>\n        \n<p class=\"text-gray-100\">\n        Invest better with The Motley Fool.

Cautioning investors, they noted that “numbers are too high,” recommending a “recalibration” of consensus estimates. Despite these near-term challenges, Jefferies retains confidence in Clorox’s long-term strengths. The firm views the company’s strong consumer staples portfolio and established brand as sufficient to weather temporary operational disruptions. While acknowledging potential volatility in the quarters ahead, Jefferies believes that once the ERP implementation settles, The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) will return to a more stable growth trajectory.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <div class=\"wrapper yf-eondll\" data-testid=\"inarticle-ad\">  <div id=\"sda-INARTICLE-f031419a-0cad-371d-861a-b34e7af7b1b2-1\" class=\"sdaContainer  dv-all sda-INARTICLE-f031419a-0cad-371d-861a-b34e7af7b1b2-1 yf-1m4k8v7 overflow margin  visible placeholder\" data-testid=\"ad-container\" data-ad-unit=\"/22888152279/us/yfin/ros/dt/us_yfin_ros_dt_mid_center\" data-ad-size=\"970x250,728x90,300x250,fluid\" data-ad-region=\"main-dynamic\" data-ad-loc=\"mid_center\" style=\"--placeholder-height: 250px;\"></div></div>   <p class=\"yf-1090901\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Investors are advised to brace for “operating leverage and deleverage that surprises” during the transition period, but remain optimistic about management’s ability to manage through the upheaval and eventually deliver on its core fundamentals.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class=\"yf-1090901\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->While we acknowledge the potential of CLX to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

The firm praised its disciplined pricing strategies, persistent control over input costs, and robust demand across its wine and spirit labels. Constellation also continues to benefit from expanding distribution and brand investment in its core markets, including its trend-forward premium offerings. Yet, Lieberman noted, these positives are not fully reflected in current market sentiment. The stock has lagged behind peers despite top-line momentum and margin improvements. She suggested the discrepancy may stem from macroeconomic anxieties or broader sector rotation, rather than any weakness in Constellation’s business model.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <div class=\"wrapper yf-eondll\" data-testid=\"inarticle-ad\">  <div id=\"sda-INARTICLE-4053c44e-a145-3c9f-b5ec-fe5aad4af7a6-1\" class=\"sdaContainer  dv-all sda-INARTICLE-4053c44e-a145-3c9f-b5ec-fe5aad4af7a6-1 yf-1m4k8v7 overflow margin  visible placeholder\" data-testid=\"ad-container\" data-ad-unit=\"/22888152279/us/yfin/ros/dt/us_yfin_ros_dt_mid_center\" data-ad-size=\"970x250,728x90,300x250,fluid\" data-ad-region=\"main-dynamic\" data-ad-loc=\"mid_center\" style=\"--placeholder-height: 250px;\"></div></div>   <p class=\"yf-1090901\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Barclays sees the shares as undervalued relative to both its peers and the quality of its evidence-based strategy. The firm believes that once Constellation releases its Q1 earnings and clarifies forward guidance—especially around cost management and volume trends—the market may adjust its view. For investors focused on steady growth and execution, Barclays maintains a constructive stance on the beverage giant.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>   <p class=\"yf-1090901\"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->While we acknowledge the potential of STZ to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.
